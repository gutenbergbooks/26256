<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>ANNE NELSON</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I can do with you, I&#8217;m
sure!&#8221; declared Mistress Stoddard, looking down
at the small girl who stood on her door-step
gazing wistfully up at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;A man at the wharf said that you didn&#8217;t
have any little girls,&#8221; responded the child, &#8220;and
so I thought&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas Joe Starkweather told you, I&#8217;ll be
bound,&#8221; said Mrs. Stoddard. &#8220;Well, he&#8217;s seven
of his own to fend for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven little girls?&#8221; said Anne Nelson, in an
almost terror-stricken voice, her dark eyes looking
earnestly into the stern face that frowned
down upon her. &#8220;And what would become of
them if their mother should die, and their father
be lost at sea?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure enough. You have sense, child. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
the Starkweathers are all boys. Well, come in.
You can take your bundle to the loft and leave
it, and we&#8217;ll see what I can find for you to do.
How old are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eight last March,&#8221; responded Anne.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, a child of eight isn&#8217;t much use in a
house, but maybe you can save me steps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed, Mistress Stoddard; I did a deal
to help my father about the house. He said I
could do as much as a woman. I can sweep out
for you, and lay the table and wash the dishes,
and bring in the wood and water, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
there came a break in the little girl&#8217;s voice, and
the woman reached out a kindly hand and took
the child&#8217;s bundle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; she said, and Anne instantly felt
the tenderness of her voice. &#8220;We are poor
enough, but you&#8217;ll be welcome to food and
shelter, child, till such time as some of your
own kinsfolk send for thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no kinsfolk,&#8221; declared Anne; &#8220;my
father told me that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come you in; you&#8217;ll have a bed and a crust
while I have them to give you,&#8221; declared the
woman, and Anne Nelson went across the threshold
and up to the bare loft, where she put her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
bundle down on a wooden stool and looked
about the room.</p>
<p>There was but a narrow bed in the corner,
covered with a patchwork quilt, and the wooden
stool where Anne had put her bundle. The
one narrow window looked off across the sandy
cart tracks which served as a road toward the
blue waters of Cape Cod Bay. It was early
June, and the strong breath of the sea filled the
rough little house, bringing with it the fragrance
of the wild cherry blossoms and an odor
of pine from the scrubby growths on the low
line of hills back of the little settlement.</p>
<p>It was just a year ago, Anne remembered, as
she unwrapped her bundle, that she and her
father had sailed across the harbor from Ipswich,
where her mother had died.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will live here, at the very end of the
world, where a man may think as he pleases,&#8221;
her father had said, and had moved their few
household possessions into a three-roomed house
near the shore. Then he had given his time to
fishing, leaving Anne alone in the little house
to do as she pleased.</p>
<p>She was a quiet child, and found entertainment
in building sand houses on the beach, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
wandering along the shore searching for bright
shells and smooth pebbles, and in doing such
simple household tasks as her youth admitted.
A week before her appearance at Mrs. Stoddard&#8217;s
door, John Nelson had gone out in his fishing-boat,
and now he had been given up as lost.
No sign of him had been seen by the other fishermen,
and it was generally believed by his
neighbors that his sloop had foundered and
that John Nelson had perished.</p>
<p>Some there were, however, who declared John
Nelson to be a British spy, and hesitated not to
say that he had sailed away to join some vessel
of the British fleet with information as to the
convenience of the harbor of Province Town,
and with such other news as he had brought
from Ipswich and the settlements nearer Boston.
For it was just before the war of the American
Revolution, when men were watched sharply
and taken to task speedily for any lack of
loyalty to the American colonies. And John
Nelson had many a time declared that he believed
England meant well by her American
possessions,&mdash;a statement which set many of his
neighbors against him.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mean well,&#8217; indeed!&#8221; Joseph Starkweather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
had replied to his neighbor&#8217;s remark. &#8220;When
they have closed the port of Boston, so that no
ship but the king&#8217;s war-ships dare go in and out?
Even our fishing-boats are closely watched.
Already the Boston people are beginning to
need many things. Americans are not going to
submit to feeding British soldiers while their
own men go hungry.&#8221;</p>
<p>But now Joseph Starkweather was the only
man who interested himself in the lonely child.
Day after day of that first week of her father&#8217;s
absence Anne had stayed close to the little house,
looking hopefully out across the harbor for a
sight of his boat; and day after day Joseph Starkweather
had come lounging down the beach to
speak with the child, to ask her what she had
for breakfast, and if she slept safe and unafraid.</p>
<p>&#8220;The meal is gone,&#8221; she told him one morning,
&#8220;and I do not sleep now&mdash;I wait and listen for
my father;&#8221; and then it was that he told her
she must seek another home.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are too young to stay alone,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;pick up a bundle of your clothes and go to Mrs.
Stoddard on the hill. She hasn&#8217;t a chick or
child of her own. Like as not you&#8217;ll be a blessing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
to her.&#8221; And Anne, used to obedience and
sorrow, obeyed.</p>
<p>There was nothing of much value in the small
house, but on the day after Anne&#8217;s entrance as a
member of the Stoddard family, Captain Stoddard
loaded the poor sticks of furniture on a
handcart, and pulled it through the sandy tracks
to his cottage door.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the child of an English spy you&#8217;re giving
shelter to,&#8221; he had said, when Martha Stoddard
had told him that Anne was to live with
them, &#8220;and she&#8217;ll bring no luck to the house.&#8221;
But his wife had made no response; the dark-eyed,
elfish-looking child had already found a
place in the woman&#8217;s heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t eat so very much,&#8221; Anne announced
as Mrs. Stoddard gave her a bowl of corn mush
and milk when she came down-stairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll eat what you want in this house,
child,&#8221; answered her new friend, and Anne ate
hungrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now come to the door, Anne, and I&#8217;ll brush
out this tangle of hair of yours,&#8221; said Mrs. Stoddard;
&#8220;and after this you must keep it brushed
and braided neatly. And bring down your
other frock. I&#8217;ll be doing some washing this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
afternoon, and I venture to say your frock is in
need of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first few days in the Stoddard family
seemed almost unreal to Anne. She no longer
watched for her father&#8217;s boat, she no longer
wandered about the beach, playing in the sand
and hunting for shells. Her dresses were not
now the soiled and ragged covering which had
served as frocks, but stout cotton gowns, made
from a skirt of Mrs. Stoddard&#8217;s, and covered
with a serviceable apron. A sunbonnet of
striped cotton covered the dark head, and Anne
was as neat and well-dressed as the other children
of the settlement. To be sure her slender
feet were bare and tanned, and hardened by exposure;
but there was not a child in the neighborhood
who wore shoes until the frost came, and
Mrs. Stoddard was already making plans for
Anne&#8217;s winter foot-gear.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll trade off something for some moccasins
for the child before fall,&#8221; she had resolved;
&#8220;some of the Chatham Indians will get down
this way when the beach plums begin to ripen,
and will be glad of molasses, if I am lucky
enough to have it.&#8221;</p>
<p>For those were the days when the little coast
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
settlements had but few luxuries, and on Cape
Cod the settlers were in fear of the British.
Province Town was especially exposed, and at
that time there were but thirty houses; and the
people had no established communication with
the outside world. The sea was their thoroughfare,
as a journey over the sandy country from
Province Town to Boston was almost impossible.
News was a long time in reaching the little settlement
of fishermen. But they knew that King
George III had resolved to punish Boston for
destroying his cargoes of tea, and had made
Salem the seat of government in the place of
Boston. War-ships from England hovered about
the coast, and the children of Province Town
were quick to recognize these unwelcome craft.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mistress Stoddard,&#8221; said Anne one morning,
when she had returned from driving the cow to
the enclosed pasturage at some little distance
from the house, &#8220;Jimmie Starkweather says
there is a big ship off Race Point, and that it is
coming into harbor here. He says &#8217;tis a British
ship, and that like as not the men will land and
burn down the houses and kill all the cows.&#8221;
Anne looked at Mrs. Stoddard questioningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; responded the good woman.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
&#8220;Jimmie was but trying to make you afraid.
&#8217;Twas he sent thee running home last week in
fear of a wolf that he told you was prowling about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But there is a ship, Mistress Stoddard. I
went up the hill and looked, and &#8217;tis coming
along like a great white bird.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like enough. The big ships go up toward
Boston and Salem on every fair day. You
know that well, child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This seems a different kind,&#8221; persisted
Anne; and at last Mrs. Stoddard&#8217;s curiosity
was aroused, and with Anne close beside her
she walked briskly up to the hill and looked
anxiously across the blue waters.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis much nearer, now,&#8221; said Anne. &#8220;See,
it&#8217;s coming to&mdash;&#8217;twill anchor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure enough,&#8221; answered Mrs. Stoddard.
&#8220;Jimmie Starkweather is a wise lad. &#8217;Tis a
British man-of-war. Trouble is near at hand,
child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will they kill our cow?&#8221; questioned Anne.
&#8220;Jimmie said they would, and eat her,&#8221; and
Anne&#8217;s voice trembled; for the small brown
cow was the nearest approach to a pet that the
little girl had. It seemed a loss hardly to be
borne if &#8220;Brownie&#8221; was to be sacrificed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like enough they will,&#8221; replied Mrs.
Stoddard. &#8220;They&#8217;ll be sending their boats
ashore and taking what they can see. Run
back to the pasture, Anne, and drive Brownie
down the further slope toward the salt-meadow.
There&#8217;s good feed for her beyond the wood there,
and she&#8217;ll not wander far before nightfall, and
she will not be quickly seen there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne needed no urging. With another look
toward the big ship, she fled back along the
sandy road toward the pasture, and in a short
time the brown cow, much surprised and offended,
was being driven at a run down the
pasture slope, around the grove of scrubby
maples to the little valley beyond.</p>
<p>Anne waited until Brownie had sufficiently
recovered from her surprise to begin feeding
again, apparently well content with her new
pasturage, and then walked slowly back toward
the harbor. The village seemed almost deserted.
The children were not playing about the boats;
there was no one bringing water from the spring
near the shore, and as Anne looked out toward
the harbor, she saw two more big ships coming
swiftly toward anchorage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Brownie!&#8221; she said aloud, for if there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
was danger in one ship she was sure that three
meant that there was no hope for the gentle
brown cow which she had just driven to a place
of safety.</p>
<p>Before night a boatload of British sailors had
landed, filled their water-barrels at the spring,
bought some young calves of Joseph Starkweather
and returned quietly to their ships.</p>
<p>&#8220;They seem civil enough,&#8221; said Captain
Stoddard that night as he talked the newcomers
over with his wife. &#8220;They know we could
make no stand against them, but they treated
Joseph Starkweather fairly enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne listened eagerly. &#8220;Will they take
Brownie?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed they won&#8217;t if I can help it,&#8221; answered
Mrs. Stoddard; &#8220;we&#8217;ll not drive the
creature back and forth while the British are
about. I can slip over the hill with a bucket
and milk her night and morning. She&#8217;s gentle,
and there&#8217;s no need of letting the pirates see
how sleek and fat the creature is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And may I go with you, Mistress Stoddard?&#8221;
asked Anne.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, child,&#8221; answered Mrs. Stoddard,
smilingly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>After Anne had gone up to the loft to bed
Captain Stoddard said slowly: &#8220;She seems a
good child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That she does, Enos. Good and careful of
her clothes, and eager to be of help to me. She
saves me many a step.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis John Nelson, they say, who has brought
the Britishers into harbor,&#8221; responded Captain
Enos slowly. &#8220;Joseph Starkweather swears
that one of the sailors told him so when he
bargained for the calves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anne&#8217;s not to blame!&#8221; declared Mrs. Stoddard
loyally, but there was a note of anxiety in
her voice; &#8220;as you said yourself, Enos, she&#8217;s
a good child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not be keeping her if it proves true,&#8221; declared
the man stubbornly. &#8220;True it is that
they ask no military duty of any man in Province
Town, but we&#8217;re loyal folk just the same.
We may have to barter with the British to save
our poor lives, instead of turning guns on them
as we should; but no man shall say that I took
in a British spy&#8217;s child and cared for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;d but say you did a Christian deed at
the most,&#8221; said his wife. &#8220;You&#8217;re not a hard
man, Enos.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not harbor a traitor&#8217;s child,&#8221; he insisted,
and Mrs. Stoddard went sorrowfully to bed and
lay sleepless through the long night, trying to
think of some plan to keep Anne Nelson safe
and well cared for until peaceful days should
come again.</p>
<p>And Anne, too, lay long awake, wondering
what she could do to protect the little brown
cow which now rested so securely on the further
side of the hill.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>ANNE WINS A FRIEND</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Come, Anne,&#8221; called Mrs. Stoddard at so early
an hour the next morning that the June sun
was just showing itself above the eastern horizon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mistress Stoddard,&#8221; answered the little
girl promptly, and in a few minutes she came
down the steep stairs from the loft.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is early to call you, child,&#8221; said the good
woman kindly, &#8220;but the captain has made an
early start for the fishing grounds, and I liked
not to leave you alone in the house in these
troublous times; and so eat your porridge and
we&#8217;ll go and milk Brownie.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne hastened to obey; and in a few moments
the two were making their way up the
slope through the fragrant bayberry bushes, and
breathing in the sweet morning air. No one
else seemed astir in the little settlement. Now
and then a flutter of some wild bird would betray
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
that they had stepped near some low-nesting
bird; and the air was full of the morning
songs and chirrupings of robins, red-winged
blackbirds, song sparrows, and of many sea-loving
birds which built their nests among the
sand-hills, but found their food upon the shore.</p>
<p>Anne noticed all these things as they walked
along, but her thoughts were chiefly occupied
with other things. There was one question she
longed to ask Mrs. Stoddard, yet almost feared
to ask. As they reached the summit of the hill
and turned for a look at the beautiful harbor
she gained courage and spoke:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mistress Stoddard, will you please to tell me
what a &#8216;spy&#8217; is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A spy? and why do you wish to know,
Anne?&#8221; responded her friend; &#8220;who has been
talking to you of spies?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it an ill-seeming word?&#8221; questioned the
child anxiously. &#8220;The Cary children did call
it after me yesterday when I went to the spring.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they that!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Stoddard
angrily, &#8220;and what reply did you make, Anne?&#8221;</p>
<p>The little girl shook her head. &#8220;I said nothing.
I knew not what they might mean. Does
it mean an orphan child, Mistress Stoddard?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
and the little girl lifted her dark eyes appealingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will tell you its meaning, Anne, and then
you will see that it has naught to do with little
girls. A &#8216;spy&#8217; is like this: Suppose some one
should wish to know if I kept my house in
order, and what I gave the captain for dinner,
and could not find out, and so she came to you
and said, &#8216;Anne Nelson, if you will tell me about
the Stoddard household, and open the door that
I may come in and see for myself, I will give
thee a shilling and a packet of sweets&#8217;; then,
if you should agree to the bargain, then you
could be called a spy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I would not do such a thing!&#8221; declared
Anne, a little flash of resentment in her dark
eyes. &#8220;Do the Cary children think me like
that? I will throw water on them when next
we meet at the spring&mdash;aye, and sand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nay, Anne,&#8221; reproved Mrs. Stoddard, but
she was not ill-pleased at the child&#8217;s spirit.
&#8220;Then you would be as bad as they. It does
not matter what they may say; that is neither
here nor there. If you be an honest-thinking
child and do well they cannot work harm
against you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>As they talked they had walked on and now
heard a low &#8220;Moo!&#8221; from behind a bunch of
wild cherry trees.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Brownie!&#8221; exclaimed Anne, &#8220;but
I do wish she would not &#8216;moo&#8217; like that,
Mistress Stoddard. The British might hear her
if they come up this far from shore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis only to remind me that it is time she
was milked,&#8221; said Mrs. Stoddard. &#8220;You can
play about here, child, till I have finished.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne did not wander far. There was something
else she wished to know, and when the
bucket was filled with foamy, fragrant milk, of
which Mrs. Stoddard bade the child drink, she
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis near a month since my father went. The
Cary children also called after me that my father
was a &#8216;traitor&#8217;; is that an ill-seeming word?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The little oafs!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Stoddard,
&#8220;and what else did they say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twill not make you dislike me, Mistress
Stoddard?&#8221; questioned the child. &#8220;I honestly
do not know why they should so beset me.
But they called me &#8216;beggar&#8217; as well, whatever
that may be; though I&#8217;m sure I am not it, if it
be an ill-seeming word.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>Mrs. Stoddard had set down her milking-pail;
Brownie was quietly feeding near by; there was
no one to see, and she put her arm about the
little girl and drew her near. It was the first
outward show of tenderness that she had made
toward the child, and as Anne felt the kindly
pressure of her arm and looked up into the
tender eyes her own face brightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll sit here for a bit and rest, child,&#8221; said
Mrs. Stoddard, &#8220;and be sure I think only well
of you. Thou art a dear child, and I will not
have aught harm thee or make thee unhappy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne drew a long breath, and snuggled closely
to her good friend&#8217;s side. A great load was
lifted from her sad little heart, for since she had
come to Province Town she could remember but
few kindly words, and to have Mistress Stoddard
treat her with such loving kindness was happiness
indeed. For a moment she forgot the taunts
of the Cary children, and sat silent and smiling,
her head resting against Mrs. Stoddard&#8217;s shoulder.
There was a peaceful little silence between the
two, and then Anne spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would wish to know what &#8216;traitor&#8217; might
mean, Mistress Stoddard?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Very like to &#8216;spy,&#8217;&#8221; answered Mrs. Stoddard.
&#8220;The children meant that your father had told
the British that they could find good harbor and
provisions here. That, like a spy, he had opened
the door of a friend&#8217;s house for silver.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne sprang from the arm that had encircled
her, her cheeks flushed and her eyes blazing.
&#8220;Now!&#8221; she declared, &#8220;I <i>will</i> throw water upon
them when I go to the spring! All that the
bucket will hold I will splash upon them,&#8221; and
she made a fierce movement as if casting buckets
full of wrath upon her enemies, &#8220;and sand!&#8221;
she continued; &#8220;while they are wet with the
water I will throw sand upon them. &#8217;Tis worse
to say things of my father than of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come here, child,&#8221; said Mrs. Stoddard; &#8220;we
will not let words like the Cary children speak
trouble us. And you will remember, Anne, that
I shall be ill-pleased if I hear of water-throwing
at the spring. Come, now, we&#8217;ll be going toward
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne made no response, but walked quietly
on beside her companion. When they reached
the hilltop they paused again before going down
the slope toward home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, Anne! Are not the fishing-boats all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
at anchor? What means it that the men are
not about their fishing? We&#8217;d best hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Enos met them at the door. He
gave Anne no word of greeting, but said to his
wife, &#8220;The British tell us to keep ashore.
They&#8217;ll have no fishing. They know full well
how easy &#8217;tis for a good sloop to carry news up
the harbor. They are well posted as to how such
things are done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what can we do if we cannot fish?&#8221;
exclaimed Mrs. Stoddard. &#8220;&#8217;Tis well known
that this sandy point is no place for gardens.
We can scarce raise vegetables enough to know
what they mean. And as for corn and wheat,
every grain of them worth counting has to be
bought from the other settlements and paid for
in fish. If we do not fish how shall we eat?&#8221;</p>
<p>The captain shook his head. &#8220;Go about
your play, child,&#8221; he said, turning toward
Anne, and the little girl walked slowly away
toward a bunch of scrubby pine trees near which
she had established a playhouse. She had built
a cupboard of smooth chips, and here were
gathered the shells she had brought from the
beach, a wooden doll which her father had made
her, and the pieces of a broken earthenware plate.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>She took the doll from its narrow shelf and
regarded it closely. Her father had made it
with no small skill. Its round head was covered
with curls carved in the soft wood; its eyes were
colored with paint, and its mouth was red.
The body was more clumsily made, but the
arms and legs had joints, and the doll could sit
up as erect as its small mistress. It wore one
garment made of blue and white checked cotton.
It was the only toy Anne Nelson had ever possessed,
and it had seemed more her own because
she had kept it in the little playhouse under the
pines.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, you can go up to the house and live
with me,&#8221; she said happily, &#8220;and now you shall
have a truly name. You shall be Martha Nelson
now. I know my father would want you to be
called Martha, if he knew that Mrs. Stoddard put
her arm around me and called me a &#8216;dear child,&#8217;&#8221;
and Anne smiled at the remembrance.</p>
<p>She did not speak of her father before the
Stoddards, but she could not have explained
the reason for her silence. She had wondered
much about him, and often watched the harbor
yearningly, thinking that after all the old sloop
might come sailing back, bringing the slender,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
silent man who had always smiled upon her, and
praised her, and had told her that some day she
should have a Maltese kitten, and a garden with
blossoming trees and smooth paths. Anne did
not forget him, and now as she regarded her
wooden doll a great longing for a sight of his dear
face made her forget everything, and she leaned
her head against a little pine and cried silently.
But as she cried the remembrance of the taunts
of the Cary children came into her thoughts, and
she dried her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis near the hour when they go to the
spring,&#8221; she said, laying the doll carefully back
in its former resting place. &#8220;I will but walk
that way that they may not think me afraid of
their ill-seeming words,&#8221; and with her dark head
more erect than usual, Anne made her way down
the path, her brown feet sinking ankle-deep in
the warm sand at every step.</p>
<p>The Cary children, a boy and a girl, both
somewhat Anne&#8217;s seniors, were already filling
their buckets at the spring. Jimmie Starkweather
was there, and a number of younger
children ran shouting up and down the little
stream which flowed from the spring across the
road.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></p>
<p>As Anne came near, Jimmie Starkweather
called out: &#8220;Oh, Anne Nelson! The Indians
from Truro are camping at Shankpainter&#8217;s
Pond. I&#8217;ve been over there, near enough to see
them at work, this morning. My father says
they&#8217;ll be gone as soon as they see the British
vessels. We&#8217;ll not have time to buy moccasins
if they go so quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne&#8217;s eyes rested for a moment upon Jimmie,
but she did not speak. She could hear the
Carys whispering as they dipped their buckets
in the spring, and as she came nearer, their
voices rose loudly: &#8220;Daughter of a spy!
Beggar-child! Beggar-child!&#8221;</p>
<p>But their taunts vanished in splutterings and
pleas for mercy; for at their first word Anne
had sprung upon them like a young tiger. She
had wrenched the bucket of water from the
astonished boy and flung it in his face with such
energy that he had toppled over backward,
soused and whimpering; then she had turned
upon his sister, sending handful after handful
of sand into the face of that astonished child,
until she fled from her, wailing for mercy.</p>
<p>But Anne pursued her relentlessly, and
Captain Enos Stoddard, making his mournful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
way toward the shore, could hardly believe his
own senses when he looked upon the scene&mdash;the
Cary boy prostrate and humble, while his sister,
pursued by Anne, prayed for Anne to stop the
deluge of sand that seemed to fill the air about
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not be called ill-seeming names!&#8221;
shrieked Anne. &#8220;If thou sayest &#8216;traitor&#8217; or
&#8216;spy&#8217; to me again I will do worse things to
you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Stoddard stood still for a moment.
Then a slow smile crept over his weather-beaten
face. &#8220;Anne!&#8221; he called, and at the sound of
his voice the child stopped instantly. &#8220;Come
here,&#8221; he said, and she approached slowly with
hanging head. &#8220;Give me your hand, child,&#8221;
he said kindly, and the little girl slipped her
slender fingers into the big rough hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, Jimmie Starkweather, you&#8217;ll stand by
and see my little girl put upon, will you!&#8221; he
exclaimed angrily. &#8220;I thought better than that
of your father&#8217;s son, to stand by and let a small
girl be taunted with what she cannot help. It
speaks ill for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had no time, sir,&#8221; answered the boy sulkily;
&#8220;she was upon them both in a second,&#8221; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
Jimmie&#8217;s face brightened; &#8220;it was fine, sir, the
way she sent yon lubber over,&#8221; and he pointed
a scornful finger toward the Cary boy, who was
now slinking after his sister.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, you Cary boy!&#8221; called the captain,
&#8220;come back here and heed what I say to you.
If I know of your opening your mouth with
such talk again to my girl here,&#8221; and he nodded
toward Anne, &#8220;I&#8217;ll deal with you myself. So
look out for yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see he keeps a civil tongue, sir,&#8221; volunteered
Jimmie, and Captain Enos nodded approvingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Anne, we&#8217;d best step up home,&#8221; said
the captain. &#8220;I expect Mistress Stoddard will
not be pleased at this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne clung close to the big hand but said no
word.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not angry, child,&#8221; went on the captain.
&#8220;I like your spirit. I do not believe in being
put upon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Mistress Stoddard told me I was not to
throw water and sand,&#8221; responded Anne, &#8220;and I
forgot her commands. I fear she will not like
me now,&#8221; and remorseful tears dropped over the
flushed little cheeks.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There, there! Do not cry, Anne,&#8221; comforted
the captain; &#8220;I will tell her all about it.
She will not blame you. You are my little girl
now, and those Cary oafs will not dare open their
mouths to plague you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Stoddard, looking toward the shore,
could hardly credit what she saw&mdash;the captain,
who but yesterday had declared that Anne
should not stay under his roof, leading the child
tenderly and smiling upon her!</p>
<p>&#8220;Heaven be thanked!&#8221; she murmured.
&#8220;Enos has come to his senses. There&#8217;ll be no
more trouble about Anne staying.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>ANNE&#8217;S SECRET</h3>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Stoddard said nothing to Anne of the
trouble at the spring, and when Anne would
have explained her part in it, her friend said
quickly: &#8220;Captain Enos is not displeased with
you, Anne. He thinks the Cary children not
well taught at home, and says for you not to play
with them,&#8221; so that Anne had gone happily back
to her playhouse, and told &#8220;Martha&#8221; that there
was no one so good as Mistress and Captain Stoddard,
&#8220;except my dear father,&#8221; the little girl had
added loyally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Martha, you must be a good and quiet
child,&#8221; she advised, &#8220;for after this you will live
in the house with me. You can come out here
to play with me, but every night you are to
sleep in my bed; and it may be, Mistress Stoddard
will let you rest in the kitchen now and
then, and you may go with me over the pasture
hill to see Brownie.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>The big British ships lay quietly at anchor
for several days. The men came ashore in boat-loads,
washed their clothes at the spring, bought
such provisions as the little settlement could
offer, and wandered about the shore. The citizens
treated them not uncivilly, for since the
men of Province Town were unable to make
any resistance to those they felt to be their
country&#8217;s foes, they knew it to be best to be
silent and accept the authority they had not the
strength to defy. So the fishing-boats swung at
anchor in the harbor, and the men lingered
about the landing, or fished for plaice fish and
sole from their dories near shore.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be poor indeed when frost comes,&#8221;
complained Mrs. Stoddard; &#8220;my molasses keg
is near empty now, and the meal barrel not half
full. If those Britishers do not soon leave the
harbor so that the men can get back to the fishing,
this place will know hunger, for our larder
is no poorer than our neighbors&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Captain Enos, &#8220;the whole
coast is feeling the king&#8217;s displeasure because
we will not pay him taxes to fill his pockets,
and make slaves of us. I wish we had some
news of our Boston friends. The Freemans
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
are well to do, but with Boston beset on all
sides with British soldiers they may be hard
pressed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twill come to worse yet, be sure,&#8221; predicted
Mrs. Stoddard gloomily.</p>
<p>It was but a few days after this when with
joyful songs the British sailors made ready to
sail, and on a bright July morning the vessels,
taking advantage of a fair wind, bent their sails
and skimmed away up the coast.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are bound for Boston,&#8221; declared Captain
Enos, &#8220;and &#8217;Tis soon enough they&#8217;ll be back
again. The Boston folk will not let them come
to anchor, I&#8217;ll be bound.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hardly had the ships got under headway before
the fishermen were rowing out to their sailboats,
and soon the little fleet was under sail
bound off Race Point toward the fishing
grounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Anne, you had best go after Brownie
and bring her back to her old pasture. I like
not the long tramp morning and night to milk
the creature,&#8221; said Mrs. Stoddard, and she
watched Anne, with the wooden doll clasped in
her arm, go obediently off on her errand.</p>
<p>A little smile crept over her face as she stood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
in the doorway. &#8220;Captain Enos would like
well that Anne be called Anne Stoddard,&#8221; she
said aloud; &#8220;he begins to recall good traits in
her father, and to think no other child in the
settlement has the spirit that our girl has. And
I am well pleased that it is so,&#8221; she concluded
with a little sigh, &#8220;for there will be poor days
ahead for us to bear, and had the captain not
changed his mind about Anne I should indeed
have had hard work to manage,&#8221; and she
turned back to her simple household tasks.</p>
<p>Anne went slowly up the sandy slope, stopping
here and there to see if the beach plums
showed any signs of ripening, and turning now
and then to see if she could pick out Captain
Enos&#8217;s sail among the boats going swiftly out
toward the open sea.</p>
<p>As she came in sight of the little grove of
maples her quick eyes saw a man moving
among them. Brownie was quietly feeding,
evidently undisturbed. Anne stopped, holding
Martha very tightly, her eyes fixed upon the
moving figure. She was not afraid, but she
wondered who it was, for she thought that
every man in the settlement had gone to the
fishing grounds. As she looked, something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
familiar in the man&#8217;s movements sent her running
toward the grove.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my father. I know it is my father,&#8221;
she whispered to herself. As she came down
the slope the man evidently saw her, for he
came out from the wood a little as if waiting
for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anne, Anne!&#8221; he exclaimed, as she came
near, and in a moment his arm was around her
and he was clasping her close.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come back in the wood, dear child,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;And you have not forgotten your
father?&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne smiled up at him happily. &#8220;I could
never do that,&#8221; she responded. &#8220;See, here is
my doll. Her name is Martha Stoddard Nelson.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An excellent name,&#8221; declared the man
smilingly. &#8220;How neat and rosy you look,
Anne! You look as if you had fared well. Be
they kind to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, father. They say now that I am
their little girl. But I am not,&#8221; and Anne
shook her head smilingly. &#8220;I am my own
father&#8217;s little girl; though I like them well,&#8221;
she added.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>The two were seated on a grassy hummock
where no eye could see them; but from time to
time John Nelson looked about furtively as if
expecting some one to appear.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not a &#8216;traitor&#8217; or a &#8216;spy,&#8217; are you,
father?&#8221; questioned the child. &#8220;When the
Cary children did say so I chased them from
the spring, and Captain Enos said I did well.
But I did think you lost at sea, father!&#8221;</p>
<p>The man shook his head. &#8220;Try and remember
what I tell you, child, that you may know
your father for an honest man. The day I left harbor
on my fishing trip I was run down by one of
those British vessels. The sloop sank, and they
threw me a rope and pulled me on board. It
was rare sport for their sailors to see me struggle
for my very life.&#8221; The man stopped and his face
grew very grave and stern. &#8220;Then they said
they were coming into Cape Cod Harbor, and
that I should be their pilot. They said they
would make a good bonfire of the shanties of
the settlement. And then, child, I misled them.
I laughed and said, &#8216;&#8217;Tis a settlement of good
Royalists if ever there was one.&#8217; They would
scarce believe me. But they came into harbor,
and when the men proved civil and refused them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
nothing, then they credited what I said. But
they told me they were bound for Dorchester
Harbor, and there they would make a good English
soldier of me. I said nothing, but this morning,
in the confusion of making sail, I slipped
overboard and swam ashore, bound that I would
have a look at my girl and know her safe and
well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And now, father, shall we go back and live
in the little house by the shore? Mistress Stoddard
has kept our things safely, and she has
taught me many useful things,&#8221; said Anne
proudly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, child. For me to stay in this settlement
would bring trouble upon it. Those ships will
return here, and if I were found among the men
here, then, indeed, would their anger be great.
They must think me drowned, else they would
indeed make a bonfire of every house along the
shore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what will you do, father? You must
stay with me now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, dear child. I must make my way up the
cape to the settlements and join the Americans.
My eyes are opened: &#8217;Tis right that they should
protect their homes. I will have some information
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
for them, and I no longer have any place
here. The Stoddards are good to you, Anne?
They task thee not beyond thy strength? and
they speak pleasantly to thee?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are ever kind, father; they do smile
on me, and Captain Enos does always give me
the best piece of fish at table; and he told the
Cary children that I was his little girl, and
that I was not to be plagued. But he is not my
own father,&#8221; answered Anne, &#8220;and if you must
go up the cape I will go with you. The nights
are warm and pleasant, and I shall like well to
sleep out-of-doors with the stars shining down
on us. And if you go with the Americans I
will go too. They will not mind one little
girl!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her father smoothed the dark hair tenderly
and smiled at the eager, upturned face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You love me, Anne, and I&#8217;ll not forget that
I have a dear, brave daughter waiting for me.
I&#8217;ll be the braver and the better man remembering.
But you cannot go with me. I shall be
scant fed and footsore for many a long day, and
I will not let you bear any hardship I can keep
from you. It will be a joy to me to know you
safe with Mistress Stoddard; and if I live they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
shall be repaid for all they do for you. They
are indeed kind to you?&#8221; he again questioned
anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are indeed,&#8221; responded Anne, seriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I must begin my journey, Anne. And
do not say that you have seen me. Keep in
your heart all I have told you. I shall come
for you when I can. But you are to be happy
and not think of me as in danger. A brave
man is always quite safe, and I wish you to
believe that your father is a brave man, Anne.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I not to tell Mistress Stoddard?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell no one, Anne. Remember. Promise
me that when they speak of me as drowned you
will say no word!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not speak, father. But if they do say
&#8216;traitor&#8217; or &#8216;spy&#8217; I am not to bear it. Captain
Enos said I need not.&#8221;</p>
<p>A little smile came over the man&#8217;s face and
he nodded silently. Then he kissed his little
daughter and again promising that it should
not be long before he would come for her, he
turned and made his way through the wood,
and soon Anne could no longer see him.</p>
<p>For a long time the little girl sat silent and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
sorrowful where he had left her. She had forgotten
all about the little brown cow; her wooden
doll lay neglected on the grass beside her. But
after a little she remembered the errand on
which she had been sent, and, picking Martha
up, started off to drive Brownie back to the pasture
near home.</p>
<p>Anne was so quiet that day that at night Mrs.
Stoddard questioned her anxiously. &#8220;Have
those Cary children been saying hateful words
to you again, child?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I have not been to the spring,&#8221; answered
Anne.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has Jimmie Starkweather been telling thee
more foolish tales of a big wolf that comes
prowling about at night?&#8221; continued Mrs.
Stoddard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, Mistress Stoddard. And indeed
I do not think Jimmie Starkweather would
frighten me. You know his father has seen the
wolf. &#8217;Twas near Blackwater Pond.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, child, I fear you are ill. Your face is
flushed and you left your porridge untasted.
Would you like it better if I put a spoonful of
molasses over it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne nodded soberly. Molasses was not to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
be refused, even if she must live without her
brave father; and so she ate her porridge, and
Mrs. Stoddard patted her on the shoulder, and
told her that the beach-plums would soon be
ripening and then she should have a pie, sweet
and crusty. And if the captain did well at the
fishing, and the British ships kept their distance,
she should have some barley sugar, a great treat
in those days.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be getting you some sort of foot-gear
before long, too,&#8221; promised Mrs. Stoddard. &#8220;I
have enough wool yarn in the house to knit
you a good pair of warm stockings. &#8217;Tis an
ugly gray; I wish I could plan some sort of dye
for it to make it a prettier color.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I like gray,&#8221; said Anne. &#8220;Last winter
my feet were cold, and ached with the chilblains.
My father knew not how to get stockings
for me, and cut down his own, but they
were hard to wear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say so!&#8221; said Mrs. Stoddard; &#8220;a
man is a poor manager when it comes to fending
for children&#8217;s clothes. &#8217;Tis well I am provided
with some warm garments. When the
frost comes you shall learn to knit, Anne; and
if we be in good fortune you shall do a sampler,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
and Anne, comforted and somewhat consoled by
all these pleasant plans for her future happiness,
went to sleep that night with the wooden doll
closely clasped in her arms, wishing her father
might know how good Mistress Stoddard was to
her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>ANNE AND THE WOLF</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;A pie of beach-plums, sweet and crusty,&#8221;
Anne repeated to herself the next day as she
carried Martha out to the playhouse, and rearranged
her bits of crockery, and looked off
across the harbor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do wish they would ripen speedily,&#8221; she
said aloud. &#8220;Indeed those I tasted of yesterday
had a pleasant flavor, and I am sure Mistress
Stoddard would be well pleased if I could bring
home enough for a pie. I will take the small
brown basket and follow the upper path, for the
plum bushes grow thickly there,&#8221; and Martha
was carefully settled in her accustomed place,
and Anne ran to the house for the brown basket,
and in a few moments was following a sandy
path which led toward the salt meadows.</p>
<p>She stopped often to pick the yellowing beach-plums,
and now and then tasted one hopefully,
expecting to find the sweet pungent flavor which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
the children so well loved, but only once or
twice did she discover any sign of ripeness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll cross the upper marsh,&#8221; she decided;
&#8220;&#8217;Tis not so shaded there, and the sun lies
warm till late in the day, and the plums are
sure to be sweeter. I hope my father finds
many to eat along his journey. I wish I had
told him that it was best for me to go with him.
We could have made little fires at night and
cooked a fish, and, with berries to eat, it would
not have been unpleasant.&#8221;</p>
<p>The July sun beat warmly down, but a little
breath of air from the sea moved steadily across
the marshes filled with many pleasant odors.
Here and there big bunches of marsh rosemary
made spots of soft violet upon the brown grass,
and now and then little flocks of sand-peeps
rose from the ground and fluttered noisily away.
But there was a pleasant midsummer stillness in
the air, and by the time Anne had crossed the
marsh and reached the shade of a low-growing
oak tree she began to feel tired and content to
rest a time before continuing her search for ripe
beach-plums.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I had put Martha in the basket,&#8221; she
thought as she leaned comfortably back against
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
the scrubby trunk of the little tree; &#8220;then I
could have something to talk to.&#8221; But she had
not much time to regret her playmate, for in a
second her eyes had closed and she was fast
asleep. There was a movement in the bushes
behind her, a breaking of twigs, a soft fall of
padded feet, but she did not awaken.</p>
<p>A big animal with a soft, gray coat of fur,
with sharp nose and ears alertly pointed, came
out from the woods, sniffed the soft air cautiously,
and turned his head warily toward the
oak tree. The creature was evidently not
alarmed at what he saw there, for he approached
the sleeping child gently, made a noiseless circle
about her, and then settled down at her feet,
much as a big dog might have done. His nose
rested upon his paws and his sharp eyes were
upon the sleeping child.</p>
<p>In a little while Anne awoke. She had
dreamed that Jimmie Starkweather had led a
beautiful, big gray animal to Mistress Stoddard&#8217;s
door, and told her that it was a wolf that he
had tamed; so when she opened her eyes and
saw the animal so near her she did not jump
with surprise, but she said softly, &#8220;Wolf!&#8221;</p>
<p>The creature sprang to its feet at the sound of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
her voice, and moved off a few paces, and then
turned and looked over its shoulder at Anne.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wolf!&#8221; Anne repeated, brushing her hair
from her eyes and pulling her sunbonnet over
her head. Then she reached out for the plum
basket, and stood up. Still the animal had not
moved.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do believe it is tame,&#8221; thought Anne, and
she made a step toward her visitor, but the gray
wolf no longer hesitated, and with a bound it
was off on a run across the marsh, and soon disappeared
behind a clump of bushes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish it had stayed,&#8221; Anne said aloud, for
there had been nothing to make her afraid of
wild creatures, and Jimmie&#8217;s stories of a big
wolf ranging about the outskirts of the settlement
had not suggested to her that a wolf was
anything which would do her harm, and she
continued her search for beach-plums, her mind
filled with the thought of many pleasant things.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do think, Mistress Stoddard, that I have
plums enough for a pie,&#8221; she exclaimed, as she
reached the kitchen door and held up her basket
for Mistress Stoddard&#8217;s inspection.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twill take a good measure of molasses, I
fear,&#8221; declared Mrs. Stoddard, &#8220;but you shall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
have the pie, dear child. &#8217;Twill please Captain
Enos mightily to have a pie for his supper
when he gets in from the fishing; and I&#8217;ll tell
him &#8217;twas Anne who gathered the plums,&#8221; and
she nodded smilingly at the little girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what think you has happened at the
spring this morning?&#8221; she went on, taking the
basket from Anne, who followed her into the
neat little kitchen. &#8220;Jimmie Starkweather and
his father near captured a big gray wolf. The
creature walked up to the spring to drink as
meek as a calf, and Mr. Starkweather ran for his
axe to kill it, but &#8217;twas off in a second.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why should he kill it?&#8221; exclaimed
Anne. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure &#8217;Tis a good wolf. &#8217;twas no
harm for it to drink from the spring.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But a wolf is a dangerous beast,&#8221; replied
Mrs. Stoddard; &#8220;the men-folk will take some
way to capture it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne felt the tears very near her eyes. To
her, the gray wolf had not seemed dangerous.
It had looked kindly upon her, and she had already
resolved that if it ever were possible she
would like to stroke its soft fur.</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t the wolf be tamed?&#8221; she questioned.
&#8220;I went to sleep near the marsh this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
morning and dreamed that Jimmie Starkweather
had a tame wolf.&#8221; But for some
reason, which Anne herself could not have explained,
she did not tell her good friend of the
wild creature which had come so near to her
when she slept, and toward whom she had so
friendly a feeling, and Mrs. Stoddard, busy with
her preparations for pie-making, did not speak
further of the wolf.</p>
<p>There was a good catch of fish that day, and
Captain Enos came home smiling and well
pleased.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we could hope that the British ships
would keep out of harbor we could look forward
to some comfort,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but Starkweather
had news from an Ipswich fisherman that the
&#8216;Somerset&#8217; was cruising down the cape, and like
as not she&#8217;ll anchor off the village some morning.
And from what we hear, her sailors find it
good sport to lay hands on what they see.&#8221;</p>
<p>The appearance of the beach-plum pie, warm
from the oven, turned the captain&#8217;s thoughts to
more pleasant subjects. &#8220;&#8217;Tis a clever child to
find ripe beach-plums in July,&#8221; he said, as he
cut Anne a liberal piece, &#8220;and a bit of tartness
gives it an excellent flavor. Well, well, it is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
surely a pleasant thing to have a little maid in
the house,&#8221; and he nodded kindly toward Anne.</p>
<p>After supper when Anne had gone up to her
little chamber under the eaves, and Captain
Enos and Mrs. Stoddard were sitting upon their
front door-step enjoying the cool of the evening,
Captain Enos said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Martha, Anne calls you Mistress Stoddard,
does she not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Always,&#8221; answered his wife. &#8220;She is a
most thoughtful and respectful child. Never
does she speak of thee, Enos, except to say &#8216;Captain.&#8217;
She has been in the house for over two
months now, and I see no fault in her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A quick temper,&#8221; responded Captain Enos,
but his tone was not that of a person who had discovered
a fault. Indeed he smiled as he spoke,
remembering the flight of the Cary children.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like well to have the little maid
feel that we were pleased with her,&#8221; continued
the captain slowly. &#8220;If she felt like calling
me &#8216;Father&#8217; and you &#8216;Mother,&#8217; I should see no
harm in it, and perhaps &#8217;twould be well to have
her name put on the town records as bearing
our name, Anne Stoddard?&#8221; and Captain Enos
regarded his wife questioningly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is what I have been wishing for, Enos!&#8221;
exclaimed Mrs. Stoddard, &#8220;but maybe &#8217;twere
better for the child to call us &#8216;Uncle&#8217; and
&#8216;Aunt.&#8217; She does not yet forget her own father,
you see, and she might feel &#8217;twere not right to
give another his name.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Enos nodded approvingly. &#8220;A good
and loyal heart she has, I know,&#8221; he answered,
&#8220;and &#8217;twill be better indeed not to puzzle the
little maid. We&#8217;ll be &#8216;Uncle&#8217; and &#8216;Aunt&#8217; to
her then, Martha; and as for her name on the
town records, perhaps we&#8217;ll let the matter rest
till Anne is old enough to choose for herself.
If the British keep on harrying us it may well
be that we fisherfolk will have to go further up
the coast for safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And desert Province Town?&#8221; exclaimed
Mrs. Stoddard, &#8220;the place where your father
and mine, Enos, were born and died, and their
fathers before them. No&mdash;we&#8217;ll not search for
safety at such a price. I doubt if I could live
in those shut-in places such as I hear the upper
landings are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Enos chuckled approvingly. &#8220;I
knew well what you would say to that, Martha,&#8221;
he replied, &#8220;and now we must get our sleep, for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
the tide serves early to-morrow morning, and I
must make the best of these good days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Enos was well pleased with the pie,
Anne,&#8221; said Mrs. Stoddard the next morning,
as the little girl stood beside her, carefully wiping
the heavy ironware.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> &#8220;And what does thee
think! The captain loves thee so well, child,
that it would please him to have thee call him
Uncle Enos. That is kind of him, is it not,
Anne?&#8221; and Mistress Stoddard smiled down at
the eager little face at her elbow.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is indeed, Mistress Stoddard,&#8221; replied
Anne happily; &#8220;shall I begin to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, child, and I shall like it well if you
call me &#8216;Aunt&#8217;; &#8217;twill seem nearer than &#8216;Mistress
Stoddard,&#8217; and you are same as our own
child now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne&#8217;s dark eyes looked up earnestly into
Mistress Stoddard&#8217;s kind face. &#8220;But I am my
father&#8217;s little girl, too,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you are,&#8221; answered her friend.
&#8220;Captain Enos and I are not asking you to forget
your father, child. No doubt he did his
best for you, but you are to care for us, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I do, Aunt Martha; I love you well,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
said Anne, so naturally that Mrs. Stoddard
stopped her work long enough to give her a kiss
and to say, &#8220;There, child, now we are all settled.
&#8217;twill please your Uncle Enos well.&#8221;</p>
<p>As soon as the few dishes were set away
Anne wandered down the hill toward the
spring. She no longer feared the Cary children,
and she hoped to see some of the Starkweather
family and hear more of the gray wolf, and at
the spring she found Jimmie with two wooden
buckets filled and ready for him to carry home
to his waiting mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;You missed the great sight yesterday,
Anne,&#8221; he said, as she approached the spring.
&#8220;What think you! A wolf as big as a calf
walked boldly up and drank, right where I
stand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;twas not as big as a calf,&#8221; declared Anne;
&#8220;and why should you seek to kill a wild creature
who wants but a drink? &#8217;Tis not a bad
wolf.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmie looked at her in surprise, his gray
eyes widening and shining in wonder. &#8220;All
wolves are bad,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;This same gray
wolf walked off with Widow Bett&#8217;s plumpest hen
and devoured it before her very eyes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the poor creature was hungry. We
eat plump hens, when we can get them,&#8221; answered
Anne.</p>
<p>Jimmie laughed good-naturedly. &#8220;Wait till
you see the beast, Anne,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Its
eyes shine like black water, and its teeth show
like pointed rocks. You&#8217;d not stand up for it
so boldly if you had but seen it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne made no answer; she was not even
tempted to tell Jimmie that she had seen the
animal, had been almost within arm&#8217;s reach of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must be going,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but do not
harm the wolf, Jimmie,&#8221; and she looked at the
boy pleadingly; &#8220;perhaps it knows no better
than to take food when it is hungry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like its skin for a coat,&#8221; the boy answered,
&#8220;but &#8217;Tis a wise beast and knows well
how to take care of itself. It&#8217;s miles away by
this time,&#8221; and picking up the buckets he
started toward home, and Anne turned away
from the spring and walked toward the little
pasture where Brownie fed in safety.</p>
<p>She stopped to speak to the little brown cow
and to give her a handful of tender grass, and
then wandered down the slope and along the
edge of the marsh.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe &#8217;twill come again,&#8221; she thought, as
she reached the little oak tree and sat down
where she had slept the day before. &#8220;Perhaps
if I sit very still it will come out again. I&#8217;m
sure &#8217;Tis not an unfriendly beast.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little girl sat very still; she did not feel
sleepy or tired, and her dark eyes scanned the
marsh hopefully, but as the summer morning
drifted toward noon she began to realize that
her watch was in vain.</p>
<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose Jimmie Starkweather was right,
and the gray wolf is miles away,&#8221; she thought,
as she decided that she must leave the shadow
of the oak and hurry toward home so that Aunt
Martha would not be anxious about her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish the wolf knew I liked him,&#8221; the little
girl said aloud, as she turned her face toward
home. &#8220;I would not chase him away from the
spring, and I would not want his gray fur for a
coat,&#8221; and Anne&#8217;s face was very sober, as she
sent a lingering look along the thick-growing
woods that bordered the marsh. She often
thought of the wolf, but she never saw it again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>SCARLET STOCKINGS</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Good news from Truro, Captain Enos,&#8221; said
Joseph Starkweather, one morning in August,
as the two neighbors met at the boat landing.
&#8220;There&#8217;ll be good hope for American freedom
if all our settlements show as much wit and
courage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what have Truro men done?&#8221; demanded
Captain Enos. &#8220;They are mostly of
the same blood as our Province Town folks, and
would naturally be of some wit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joseph Starkweather&#8217;s eyes brightened and
twinkled at his neighbor&#8217;s answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;twas the sand-hills helped them,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;You know the little valleys between
the row of sand-hills near the shore? Well, the
British fleet made anchorage off there some days
since, and the Truro men had no mind for them
to land and spy out how few there were. So
they gathered in one of those little valleys and,
carrying smooth poles to look like muskets,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
they marched out in regular file like soldiers
over the sand-hill; then down they went through
the opposite depression and around the hill and
back, and then up they came again, constantly
marching; and the British, who could be seen
getting boats ready to land, thought better of it.
They believed that an immense force of American
soldiers had assembled, and the ships hoisted
sail and made off. &#8217;twas good work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed it was,&#8221; responded Captain Enos.
&#8220;I could wish that we of this settlement were
not so at the mercy of the British. Our harbor
is too good. It draws them like a magnet. I
do think three thousand ships might find safe
anchorage here,&#8221; and Captain Enos turned an
admiring look out across the beautiful harbor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any news of John Nelson?&#8221; questioned
Joseph Starkweather.</p>
<p>&#8220;How could there be news of a man whose
boat sunk under him well off Race Point in a
southerly gale?&#8221; responded Captain Stoddard.</p>
<p>Joseph approached a step nearer his companion
and said: &#8220;He was on one of the
British ships, Enos; he was seen there, and
now news comes by way of a Newburyport fisherman
that &#8217;twas no fault of John Nelson&#8217;s.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
The Britishers ran down his boat and took him
on board their ship, and the news goes that
when the fleet anchored off here Nelson escaped;
swam ashore in the night, the story goes, and
made his way to Wellfleet and joined the Americans
at Dorchester who are ready to resist the
British if need be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Enos&#8217;s face brightened as he listened.
&#8220;That is indeed good news!&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am
glad for our little maid&#8217;s sake that her father is
known to be a loyal man. But &#8217;Tis strange he
did not seek to see Anne,&#8221; he continued thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;John Nelson loved the little maid well,&#8221;
declared Joseph Starkweather. &#8220;He had but
poor luck here, but he did his best. The Newburyport
man tells that the British are in great
anger at his escape, and vow that the settlement
here shall pay well for it when they make harbor
here again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have no arms to defend the harbor. &#8217;Tis
hard work to rest quiet here,&#8221; said Captain
Enos; &#8220;but it is great news to know that our
little maid&#8217;s father is a loyal man. We like the
child well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;twas I sent Anne to your house, Enos,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
responded Joseph. &#8220;My own is so full that I
dared not ask Mistress Starkweather to take the
child in; and I knew your wife for a kind-hearted
woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a good thought, Joseph,&#8221; responded
the captain, &#8220;and Anne seems well content with
us. She has her playhouse under the trees, and
amuses herself without making trouble. She is
a helpful little maid, too, saving Mistress Stoddard
many a step. I must be going toward
home. There was an excellent chowder planned
for my dinner, and Martha will rejoice at the
news from Truro,&#8221; and the captain hurried
toward home.</p>
<p>Half-way up the hill he saw Anne, coming to
meet him. &#8220;Uncle Enos! Uncle Enos!&#8221; she
called, &#8220;Brownie is lost! Indeed she is. All
the morning have I gone up and down the
pasture, calling her name and looking everywhere
for her, and she is not to be found.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; responded Captain Enos; &#8220;&#8217;Tis
sure the Britishers have not stolen her, for there
is not one of their craft in sight. The cow is
probably feeding somewhere about; we&#8217;ll find
her safe in some good pasturage. Is the chowder
steaming hot and waiting?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Uncle Enos,&#8221; replied Anne, slipping
her hand into the captain&#8217;s, &#8220;but Aunt Martha
is greatly concerned about Brownie. She fears
the Indians may have driven her off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll cruise about a little after dinner,&#8221;
answered the captain. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like to think
that the Indians would show themselves unfriendly
just now,&#8221; and his pleasant face grew
stern and serious.</p>
<p>But his appetite for the chowder was excellent,
and when he started out to search for Brownie
he was sure that he would find her near the
marsh or perhaps in the maple grove further on,
where the cattle sometimes wandered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Anne, I have an errand for you to do,&#8221;
said Mrs. Stoddard, as the captain started on his
search. &#8220;I&#8217;ve just remembered that the Starkweather
children had good stockings last year
of crimson yarn. Now it may be that Mrs.
Starkweather has more on hand, and that I
could exchange my gray, as she has stout boys
to wear gray stockings, for her scarlet yarn; and
then we&#8217;ll take up some stockings for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne&#8217;s face brightened. &#8220;I should well like
some scarlet stockings,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean you to be warmly clad come frost,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
said Mrs. Stoddard. &#8220;Now see that you do the
errand well. Ask Mrs. Starkweather, first of
all, if she be in good health. It is not seemly
to be too earnest in asking a favor. Then say
that Mistress Stoddard has enough excellent
gray yarn for two pair of long stockings, and
that she would take it as a kindness if Mistress
Starkweather would take it in exchange for
scarlet yarn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Aunt Martha, I will surely remember,&#8221;
and Anne started off happily.</p>
<p>As she passed the spring a shrill voice called
her name, and she turned to see Amanda Cary,
half hidden behind a small savin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come and play,&#8221; called Amanda. &#8220;I am
not angry if you did chase me. My mother
says you knew no better!&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne listened in amazement. Knew no
better! Had not Captain Enos approved of her
defense of herself, and were not the Cary
children the first to begin trouble with her! So
Anne shook her head and walked sedately on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come and play,&#8221; repeated the shrill voice.
&#8220;My brother and Jimmie Starkweather are gone
looking for our cow, and I have no one to play
with.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is your cow lost, too?&#8221; exclaimed Anne,
quite forgetting Amanda&#8217;s unkindness in this
common ill-fortune.</p>
<p>Amanda now came out from behind the savin
tree; a small, thin-faced child, with light eyes,
sandy hair and freckles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and we think the Indians have driven
them off. For the Starkweathers&#8217; cow is not to
be found. &#8217;twill be a sad loss, my mother says;
for it will leave but three cows in the town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they may be found,&#8221; insisted Anne.
&#8220;My Uncle Enos has gone now to look for
Brownie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Uncle Enos&#8217;!&#8221; repeated Amanda scornfully.
&#8220;He&#8217;s not your uncle. You are a waif.
My mother said so, and waifs do not have uncles
or fathers or anybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am no waif, for I have a father, and my
Uncle Enos will tell your mother not to say
such words of me!&#8221; declared Anne boldly, but
she felt a lump in her throat and wished very
much that she had not stopped to talk with
Amanda.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why you get angry so quick,&#8221;
said Amanda. &#8220;You get angry at everything.
I&#8217;d just as soon play with you, if you are a waif.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t play with you anyway,&#8221; said
Anne; &#8220;I have an errand to do, and if I had not
I would rather never play than play with such a
hateful, ill-speaking child as you are,&#8221; and Anne
hurried on her way toward the Starkweathers&#8217;
low-built, weather-beaten house near the shore.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be glad indeed to get rid of some of
my scarlet yarn,&#8221; declared Mrs. Starkweather,
&#8220;and you can take home a skein or two of it
and tell Mistress Stoddard that her little girl
does an errand very prettily. I could wish my
boys were as well-mannered.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne smiled, well pleased at the pleasant
words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Enos says there is no better boy than
Jimmie,&#8221; she responded. &#8220;He says he is a
smart and honest lad,&mdash;a &#8216;real Starkweather,&#8217;
he calls him,&#8221; she responded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does he so?&#8221; and the woman&#8217;s thin face
flushed with pleasure at this praise of her eldest
son. &#8220;Well, we do prize Jimmie, and &#8217;Tis good
news to know him well thought of, and you are
a kindly little maid to speak such pleasant
words. Mistress Stoddard is lucky indeed to
have you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I call her Aunt Martha now,&#8221; said Anne,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
feeling that Mrs. Starkweather was nearly as
kind as Mrs. Stoddard, and quite forgetting the
trouble of Brownie&#8217;s loss or of Amanda&#8217;s teasing
in the good woman&#8217;s pleasantness.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is well,&#8221; replied Mrs. Starkweather.
&#8220;You will bring her much happiness, I can well
see. I could wish you had come to me, child,
when your father went; but the Stoddards can
do better for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Should I have called you &#8216;Aunt&#8217;?&#8221; Anne
asked a little wistfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed you should, and you may now if
Mistress Stoddard be willing. Say to her that
I&#8217;d like well to be Aunt Starkweather to her
little maid.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Anne, with her bundle of scarlet yarn,
started toward home, much happier than when
she had rapped at Mrs. Starkweather&#8217;s door.</p>
<p>Amanda was still sitting at the spring.
&#8220;Anne,&#8221; she called shrilly, &#8220;may I go up to
your house and play with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne shook her head, and without a backward
look at the child by the spring kept on
her way toward home. She had much to tell
her Aunt Martha, who listened, well pleased at
her neighbor&#8217;s kind words.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And Amanda Cary said that their cow was
lost, and the Starkweathers&#8217; cow, too. Amos
Cary and Jimmie are off searching for them
now, and do fear the Indians have driven them
off,&#8221; said Anne.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;twill be bad fortune indeed if that be true,&#8221;
replied Mrs. Stoddard, &#8220;for we are not as well
provisioned for the winter as usual, and it would
be a worrisome thing to have the Indians bothering
us on shore and the British to fear at sea.
But I&#8217;ll take up your stockings to-day, Anne.
The yarn is a handsome color, and well spun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I will not leave Martha at the playhouse
after this,&#8221; said Anne thoughtfully;
&#8220;something might happen to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Stoddard nodded approvingly, and Anne
brought the wooden doll in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like as not your Uncle Enos will make you
a wooden chair for the doll when the evenings
get longer,&#8221; said Mrs. Stoddard. &#8220;He&#8217;s clever
with his knife, and &#8217;twill give him something
to busy his hands with. I&#8217;ll call his attention
to the doll.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My!&#8221; exclaimed Anne, &#8220;I do think an
aunt and uncle are nice to have. And a father
is too,&#8221; she added quickly, for she could not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
bear that any one should think that she had
forgotten her own father.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed, child; and there&#8217;s good news of
your own father. He was on the British ship
and escaped and made his way to Wellfleet to
join the American soldiers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Aunt Martha!&#8221; and the little girl
sprang up from her little stool and grasped her
good friend&#8217;s gown with eager hands, and then
told her the story of her father&#8217;s visit. &#8220;But I
could not tell it before,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed you are a loyal little maid,&#8221; replied
Mrs. Stoddard approvingly, &#8220;and you must always
keep a promise, but see to it that you
promise nothing quickly. I think the better of
John Nelson that he took great risk to make
sure his little daughter was safe and well cared
for. The captain will think it good news, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My father will come back some day,&#8221; declared
Anne, and Mrs. Stoddard agreed cheerfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure he will,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but do not
think of that too much, dear child. See, I have
the stitches all cast on, and your scarlet stockings
are really begun.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>CAPTURED BY INDIANS</h3>
</div>

<p>The more Anne thought about Brownie the
more fearful she became that some harm had
befallen the pretty brown cow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her foot may have caught in those twisted
roots on the hill,&#8221; thought the little girl, &#8220;or
perhaps the Indians have fastened her in the
woods. I do believe I could find her, and save
Uncle Enos the trouble,&#8221; and the more Anne
thought of it the more eager she became to
search for Brownie; and, on the day that the
scarlet stockings were begun, Anne resolved to
walk up the hill and look about for the missing
cow.</p>
<p>As she trudged along she thought of many
things, of the gray wolf, which had disappeared
completely, having probably made its way up
the cape to better hunting grounds; and she
thought a great deal about her father, and of
the day he had come to tell her of his safety.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
But Anne did not think much about the
Indians. The cape settlements had been on
friendly terms with the Chatham Indians for
some time, and the people of Province Town
were more in peril from the freebooters of the
sea than from Indians.</p>
<p>Anne had climbed the hill, passed the grove
of scrubby pines, and stood looking across the
sand-dunes toward the open sea. She had
looked carefully for Brownie, but there was no
trace of her. But Anne was sure that, at the
edge of the pine woods, some creature had been
near her. She had lived out-of-doors so much
that her ears were quick to distinguish any
sound. At first she had wondered if it might
not be the wolf, and, as she stood looking across
the sand, she almost hoped that it might be.
&#8220;Perhaps I could tame it and have it live at
our house,&#8221; she thought, and then remembered
what Aunt Martha had said: that it would be
a hard winter, &#8220;and wolves eat a good deal, I
suppose,&#8221; decided Anne, &#8220;so &#8217;twill not be wise
to tame it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Had she looked behind her she would not
have felt so secure. An Indian woman had
been following Anne, and was now within arm&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
reach of her. And Anne had just come to her
decision in regard to the wolf, when a blanket
fell over her head, was quickly twisted about
her, and she felt herself lifted from the ground.
Then she heard a chatter of voices in a strange
tongue, and realized that she was being carried
away from the pine woods. She tried to free
herself from the blanket, and tried to call out;
but she could not move, and her voice made
only a muffled sound. She heard a laugh from
the squaw who was carrying her so easily, and
in a moment felt herself dropped on the soft
sand, and held down firmly for a moment.
Then she lay quietly. She knew, though she
could not see, that a canoe was being launched.
There was talk among a number of people near
her, and then she was lifted and put into the
canoe, and again firmly held by a strong arm.
Then came the smooth dip of paddles, and
Anne knew that she was being taken away from
home, and she felt the tears on her cheeks. She
did not try to scream again, for there had been
a rough twist of the blanket about her head
when she cried out before, and she was held too
firmly to struggle. She could hear the guttural
voices of the Indians, and, after what seemed a
long time, she realized that her captors were
making a landing. She was again dropped on
sand, and now the blanket was unwound and
Anne stood up. She found herself facing three
Indian women. Two of them frowned at her,
but the younger smiled and nodded, and patted
Anne&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

A BLANKET FELL OVER HER HEAD<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></div>
<p>The two elder squaws began to talk rapidly,
but the one who stood beside Anne remained
silent. The canoe was lifted from the beach by
the two, as they talked, and carried up toward
the rough pasture-land. Anne&#8217;s companion took
her by the hand and led her after the others.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to go right home,&#8221; Anne announced.
&#8220;You must take me right back to Captain Stoddard&#8217;s.&#8221;
The young squaw shook her head,
still smiling, and Anne realized that her companion
could not understand what she said.
The little girl stopped short, and then the smile
faded from the squaw&#8217;s face; she gave her an
ugly twitch forward, and when Anne still refused
to move a stinging blow on the cheek followed.
Anne began to cry bitterly. She was
now thoroughly frightened, and began to wonder
what would become of her.</p>
<p>The squaws hid the canoe carefully, covering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
it up with vines and brush, and then started
along the shore. Anne and her companion now
kept close to the other two. And the three
squaws talked together. Now and then they
would stop, and shading their eyes with one
hand, look seaward as if watching for some expected
boat, but none appeared. Anne&#8217;s bare
feet began to ache. She believed they would be
blistered, but the women paid no attention to
her. Anne knew that they were very near the
Truro beach. She could see the big waves dashing
up in a long curving line, and as they came
round a high cliff of sand they came suddenly
upon a big fishing-boat drawn up on the beach.
Two sailors stood by it. In an instant the
squaws had turned to flee, dragging Anne with
them. But she screamed, and threw herself
down on the sand. The sailors came running
toward them, and the Indian women fled.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a white child,&#8221; exclaimed one of the
men, picking Anne up, and wiping her face
with a big soft handkerchief. &#8220;What were
they doing with you, child?&#8221; And leaning
against his friendly arm, Anne told her story,
and showed her bruised feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis lucky for you we put ashore,&#8221; said the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
man. &#8220;We&#8217;ll take you home, little maid, safe and
sound.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not from Province Town?&#8221; Anne
ventured to ask, looking up into the kind blue
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are good English sailors, my girl,&#8221; the
other man answered her question, &#8220;and we borrowed
this boat from a settler up shore to get
fish for His Majesty&#8217;s ship &#8216;Somerset&#8217;; but we&#8217;ll
take you safe home, never fear.&#8221;</p>
<p>The blue-eyed man lifted Anne into the boat,
and the two men were soon pulling strongly at
the oars.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a stiff pull to Province Town, but the
tide&#8217;s with us, William,&#8221; said the last speaker.</p>
<p>Anne sat very quiet. She was wondering if
Aunt Martha had missed her, and if Uncle Enos
would blame her for having wandered to the
outer beach. She looked up to see the sailor
whom his companion called &#8220;William&#8221; smiling
at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not be afraid,&#8221; he said kindly; &#8220;the
folks at home will be glad to see you, and you&#8217;ll
not be scolded.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne tried to smile back. She wanted to ask
him if he had any little girls of his own; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
she remembered that he was an Englishman,
and decided that it was best not to say anything.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you walk across the pasture if we set
you ashore near here?&#8221; asked the sailor, when
they had reached the smooth beach near where
Anne had been seized by the Indians. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
not be troubled again, and we cannot well round
the point to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can get home from here. I see the pine
woods,&#8221; Anne agreed, and the men ran the boat
well up on the beach, and William lifted her
out.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis hard for those tender feet,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;but be quick as you can. My name is William
Trull, if your folks ask who &#8217;twas that fetched
you home, and my mate&#8217;s name here is Richard
Jones.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you; my name is Anne Nelson,&#8221;
Anne replied.</p>
<p>She turned back and waved her hand to them
when she had reached the land above the shore,
and saw them push off their boat and row away.
It was very hard now to walk over the rough
ground, and Anne felt very tired and unhappy.
She kept steadily on, and was soon in sight of
home. Mistress Stoddard and Captain Enos
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
were both standing in the doorway looking
anxiously toward her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, Anne, and do you think you
should stay away like this? And what has become
of your sunbonnet?&#8221; questioned Mrs.
Stoddard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indians!&#8221; wailed Anne. &#8220;Indian women,
Aunt Martha! They carried me off,&#8221; and, with
Mrs. Stoddard&#8217;s arm about her, and Captain
Enos listening in angry amazement, Anne told
the story of her adventure.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;twas an evil thing!&#8221; declared the captain.
&#8220;I&#8217;m thankful the English sailors were on shore.
I&#8217;ll remember their names.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Stoddard bathed the tired feet, and
Anne was quite hungry enough to relish the
hot corn bread, even though she had no milk to
drink with it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must be careful about letting the child
wander about alone,&#8221; Captain Enos said, after
Anne was safe in bed that night. &#8220;&#8217;Twould be
ill-fortune indeed if harm befell her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll keep her more at home,&#8221; replied Mrs.
Stoddard. &#8220;She is to begin knitting now, and
that will give her amusement indoors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis said that English soldiers are coming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
into Boston by land and sea,&#8221; said Captain
Enos. &#8220;We Province Town people are exempt
from military service, but we are loyal to the
American forces, and some of us think the time
is near when we must let you women stay here
by yourselves,&#8221; and Captain Enos looked at his
wife questioningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d do our best, Enos, be sure of that,&#8221; she
answered bravely, &#8220;and I&#8217;d have Anne for company,
if you&#8217;re needed in Boston.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we stood any chance of getting there,&#8221;
complained Captain Enos, &#8220;without the Britishers
making us prisoners. No boat gets by
them, I&#8217;m told.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Talk no more of it to-night, Enos. Mayhap
things may be settled soon, and these unhappy
days well over,&#8221; and Mistress Stoddard stepped
to the door and looked out on the peaceful little
settlement. &#8220;We have great cause to rejoice
this night that our little maid is safe at home,&#8221;
she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make a good search for Brownie to-morrow,&#8221;
declared Captain Enos, &#8220;but I fear now
that the Indians have her.&#8221;</p>
<p>The good couple decided that it would be best
to say as little of Anne&#8217;s adventure as possible,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
and to tell her not to talk of it to her playmates.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll caution the mothers,&#8221; said Mrs. Stoddard,
&#8220;but &#8217;Tis no use for our little people to frighten
themselves by wondering about Indians. Maybe
they will not come near us again, and they&#8217;ll
not dare to make another mistake.&#8221; So but
little was made of Anne&#8217;s escape from the
squaws, although the children now stayed at
home more closely, and Anne did not often stray
far from Aunt Martha.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>OUT TO SEA</h3>
</div>

<p>Captain Enos and the boys returned without
having found any trace of the missing cattle,
and the villagers felt it to be a loss hardly to be
borne that three of their six cows should have
disappeared. The men went about their fishing
even more soberly than before, and the women
and children mourned loudly.</p>
<p>Amanda Cary waited at the spring each day
for Anne&#8217;s appearance. Sometimes the two
little girls did not speak, and again Amanda
would make some effort to win Anne&#8217;s notice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father is a soldier,&#8221; she declared one
morning, and when Anne nodded smilingly,
Amanda ventured a step nearer. &#8220;You may
come up to my house and see my white kittens
if you want to,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>There could be no greater temptation to Anne
than this. To have a kitten of her own had
been one of her dearest wishes, and to see and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
play with two white kittens, even Amanda&#8217;s
kittens, was a joy not lightly to be given up.
But Anne shook her head, and Amanda, surprised
and sulky, went slowly back toward
home.</p>
<p>The next morning, as Anne went toward the
spring, she met Amanda coming up the hill,
carrying a white kitten in her arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just going up to your house,&#8221; said
Amanda. &#8220;I was bringing up this white kitten
to give to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Amanda!&#8221; exclaimed Anne, quite forgetting
her old dislike of the little girl, and
reaching out eager hands for the kitten which
Amanda gave to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother said that we could not afford to
keep two kittens,&#8221; Amanda explained, &#8220;and I
thought right off that I would give one to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Amanda,&#8221; and then Anne&#8217;s face
grew sober, &#8220;but maybe my Aunt Martha will
not want me to keep it,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess she will,&#8221; ventured Amanda. &#8220;I
will go with you and find out, and if she be not
pleased I&#8217;ll find some one to take it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two little girls trudged silently along
over the sandy path. Anne carried the kitten
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
very carefully, and Amanda watched her companion
anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Mistress Stoddard says that you may keep
the kitten may I stay and play a little while?&#8221;
she asked as they came near the Stoddard house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Anne, &#8220;you may stay anyway,
and I will show you my playhouse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amanda&#8217;s thin freckled face brightened. &#8220;If
she won&#8217;t let you keep the kitten you may come
over to my house every day and play with
mine,&#8221; she said; and almost hoped that Mistress
Stoddard would not want the little white cat, for
Amanda was anxious for a playmate, and Anne
was nearer her age than any of the little girls of
the settlement.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stoddard was nearly as much pleased
with the kitten as Anne herself, and Amanda
was told that she was a good little girl, her past
unkindness was forgotten, and the two children,
taking the kitten with them, went out to the
playhouse under the pines. Amanda was allowed
to hold the wooden doll, and they played
very happily together until disturbed by a loud
noise near the shore, then they ran down the
little slope to see what was happening.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Brownie!&#8221; exclaimed Anne.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And our cow and the Starkweathers&#8217;,&#8221;
declared Amanda. &#8220;Where do you suppose
they found them?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmie Starkweather drove Brownie up to
the little barn, and Mrs. Stoddard came running
out to welcome the wanderer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did they come from, Jimmie?&#8221; she
questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;A Truro man has just driven them over,&#8221;
explained Jimmie; &#8220;he found them in his
pasture, and thinks the Indians dared not kill
them or drive them further.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good fortune to get them back,&#8221; said
Mrs. Stoddard. &#8220;Now you will have milk for
your white kitten, Anne. Since the English
sailors rescued you from the Indians, they&#8217;ve
not been about so much.&#8221;</p>
<p>The kitten was almost forgotten in petting
and feeding Brownie, and Amanda looked on
wonderingly to see Anne bring in bunches of
tender grass for the little brown cow to eat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot get near to our cow,&#8221; she said; &#8220;she
shakes her horns at me, and sniffs, and I dare
not feed her,&#8221; but she resolved to herself that she
would try and make friends with the black and
white animal of which she had always been afraid.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Come again, Amanda,&#8221; said Anne, when
Amanda said that she must go home, and the
little visitor started off happily toward home,
resolving that she would bring over her white
kitten the very next day, and wondering if her
own father could not make her a doll such as
Anne Nelson had.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thee must not forget thy knitting, Anne,&#8221;
cautioned Mrs. Stoddard, as Anne came in from
a visit to Brownie, holding the white kitten in
her arms; &#8220;&#8217;twill not be so many weeks now
before the frost will be upon us, and I must see
to it that your uncle&#8217;s stockings are ready, and
that you have mittens; so you must do your
best to help on the stockings,&#8221; and Mrs. Stoddard
handed the girl the big ball of scarlet yarn
and the stocking just begun on the shining steel
needles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember, it is knit one and seam,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;You can sit in the open doorway, child,
and when you have knit round eight times we
will call thy stint finished for the morning.
This afternoon we must go for cranberries. We
will be needing all we can gather before the
frost comes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne put the kitten down on the floor and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
took the stocking, eyeing the scarlet yarn admiringly.
She sat down in the open doorway
and began her stint, her mind filled with happy
thoughts. To have Amanda speak well of her
dear father, to know that Brownie was safe in
the barn, to possess a white kitten of her own,
and, above all, to be knitting herself a pair of
scarlet stockings made Anne feel that the world
was a very kind and friendly place. The white
kitten looked at the moving ball of yarn curiously,
and now and then made little springs
toward it, greatly to Anne&#8217;s amusement, but in
a few moments she found that her progress was
slow, and the white kitten was sent off the broad
step to play by itself on the sandy path.</p>
<p>From time to time Mrs. Stoddard would come
to look at Anne&#8217;s knitting, and to praise the
smoothness of the work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your uncle says you are to have stout
leather shoes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Elder Haven tells me
that there will be six weeks&#8217; school this autumn
and it be good news.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I go to school, Aunt Martha?&#8221; questioned
Anne, looking up from her knitting.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stoddard nodded, smiling down at the
eager little face. &#8220;Indeed you will. &#8217;twill be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
the best of changes for you. Like as not Elder
Haven will teach thee to write.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know my letters and can spell small
words,&#8221; said Anne.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll teach thee to read if time allows,&#8221;
answered Mrs. Stoddard. &#8220;Your Uncle Enos
has a fine book of large print; &#8216;Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress&#8217;
it&#8217;s named, and &#8217;Tis of interest. We will
begin on it for a lesson.&#8221;</p>
<p>That afternoon found Anne and Mrs. Stoddard
busily picking cranberries on the bog beyond
the maple grove. Jimmie Starkweather and
Amos Cary were also picking there, and before
the afternoon finished, Amanda appeared. She
came near Anne to pick and soon asked if Anne
was to go to Elder Haven&#8217;s school.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; answered Anne, &#8220;and maybe
I shall be taught writing, and then I can send a
letter, if chance offers, to my father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are always talking and thinking about
your father,&#8221; responded Amanda; &#8220;if he should
want you to leave the Stoddards I suppose you
would go in a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne&#8217;s face grew thoughtful. Never had she
been so happy and well cared for as at the Stoddards&#8217;;
to go to her father would perhaps mean
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
that she would go hungry and half-clad as in
the old days, but she remembered her father&#8217;s
loneliness, how he had always tried to do all
that he could for her, and she replied slowly, &#8220;I
guess my father might need me more than Aunt
Martha and Uncle Enos. They have each other,
and my father has only me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amanda asked no more questions, but she
kept very close to Anne and watched her with a
new interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could read,&#8221; she said, as, their
baskets well filled, the two girls walked toward
home. &#8220;I don&#8217;t even know my letters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can teach you those,&#8221; said Anne eagerly.
&#8220;I can teach you just as my dear father did me.
We used to go out on the beach in front of our
house and he would mark out the letters in the
sand and tell me their names, and then I would
mark them out. Sometimes we would make
letters as long as I am tall. Would you like me
to teach you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed. Let&#8217;s go down to the shore
now,&#8221; urged Amanda.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d best leave our berries safely at home,&#8221;
replied Anne, who did not forget her adventure
with the Indian squaws and was now very careful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
not to go too far from the settlement, and so
it was decided that they should hurry home and
leave their baskets and meet on the smooth sandy
beach near Anne&#8217;s old home.</p>
<p>Anne was the first to reach the place. She
brought with her two long smooth sticks and
had already traced out an enormous A when
Amanda appeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is &#8216;A,&#8217;&#8221; she called out. &#8220;&#8216;A&#8217; is for
Anne, and for Amanda.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know I can remember that,&#8221; said Amanda,
&#8220;and I can make it, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not long before a long row of huge letters
were shaped along the beach, and when
Amos came down he looked at them wonderingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amos, can you spell my name?&#8221; asked his
sister.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I can!&#8221; replied the boy scornfully.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll mark it out for you,&#8221; and in a short time
Amanda was repeating over and over again the
letters which formed her name.</p>
<p>After Amos had marked out his sister&#8217;s name
in the sand he started along the shore to where
a dory lay, just floating on the swell of the incoming
tide.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Amos is going to fish for flounders,&#8221; said
Amanda; &#8220;he catches a fine mess almost every
afternoon for mother to cook for supper. He&#8217;s a
great help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Want to fish?&#8221; called out Amos as the two
little girls came near the boat and watched him
bait his hooks with clams which he had dug and
brought with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Anne; &#8220;do you think I could
catch enough for Uncle Enos&#8217;s supper?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, if you&#8217;ll hurry,&#8221; answered the boy;
&#8220;climb in over the bow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The barefooted children splashed through the
shallow curl of the waves on the beach, and
clambered over the high bow of the dory. Amos
baited their lines, and with a word of advice as
to the best place to sit, he again turned to his
own fishing and soon pulled in a big, flopping,
resisting flounder.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tide isn&#8217;t right,&#8221; he declared after a few
minutes when no bite came to take the bait.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to cast off and pull a little way down
shore over the flats. They&#8217;ll be sure to bite
there. You girls sit still. You can troll your
lines if you want to. You may catch something.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></p>
<p>So Anne and Amanda sat very still while
Amos sprang ashore, untied the rope from the
stout post sunk in the beach, pushed the boat
into deeper water, and jumped in as it floated
clear from the shore.</p>
<p>It was a big, clumsy boat, and the oars were
heavy; but Amos was a stout boy of twelve used
to boats and he handled the oars very skilfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tide&#8217;s just turning,&#8221; he said; &#8220;&#8217;twill
take us down shore without much rowing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But &#8217;twill be hard coming back,&#8221; suggested
Amanda.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh! Hard! I guess I could row through
any water in this harbor,&#8221; bragged Amos, bending
to his oar so lustily that he broke one of the
wooden thole-pins, unshipped his oar, and went
over backward into the bottom of the boat,
losing his hold on the oar as he fell. He scrambled
quickly back to his seat, and endeavored to
swing the dory about with one oar so that he
could reach the one now floating rapidly away.
But he could not get within reach of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You girls move forward,&#8221; he commanded;
&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to scull,&#8221; and moving cautiously to
the stern of the boat he put his remaining oar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
in the notch cut for it and began to move it
regularly back and forth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going inshore, Amos?&#8221; questioned
his sister.</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; asked the boy. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got one
good oar, haven&#8217;t I? We can go along first-rate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad to lose a good oar,&#8221; said
Amanda.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father won&#8217;t care,&#8221; said Amos reassuringly;
&#8220;&#8217;twa&#8217;n&#8217;t a good oar. The blade was split;
&#8217;twas liable to harm somebody. He&#8217;ll not
worry at losing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dory went along very smoothly under
Amos&#8217;s sculling and with the aid of the tide.
Amanda and Anne, their lines trailing overboard,
watched eagerly for a bite, and before
long Anne had pulled in a good-sized plaice,
much to Amos&#8217;s satisfaction. He drew in his
oar to help her take out the hook, and had just
completed this task when Amanda called out:</p>
<p>&#8220;Amos! Amos! the oar&#8217;s slipping!&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy turned quickly and grabbed at the
vanishing oar, but he was too late&mdash;it had slid
into the water. They were now some distance
from shore and the tide was setting strongly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
toward the mouth of the harbor. Amos looked
after the oar and both of the little girls looked
at Amos.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are we going to do now?&#8221; asked
Amanda. &#8220;We can&#8217;t ever get back to shore.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>ON THE ISLAND</h3>
</div>

<p>Amos made no answer to his sister&#8217;s frightened
exclamation. He was well used to the harbor,
as he often went fishing with his father, and
had been on cruises of several days. Tide and
wind both took the boat swiftly toward Long
Point, a low, narrow sand-beach, which ran out
into the harbor.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll run straight into Long Point if the
wind don&#8217;t change,&#8221; said Amos.</p>
<p>Anne had held fast to her line and now felt
it tugging strongly in her grasp.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve caught something!&#8221; she exclaimed,
&#8220;and I don&#8217;t believe I can ever pull it in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amos reached across and seized the line.
&#8220;Gee!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet it&#8217;s a cod,&#8221; and
he pulled valiantly. It took all the boy&#8217;s
strength to get the big fish into the boat. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
bet it weighs ten pounds,&#8221; declared Amos
proudly, quite forgetting in his pleasure over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
the big fish that the boat was still moving
swiftly away from the settlement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amos, Amos, just see how fast we are going,&#8221;
said Amanda; &#8220;we&#8217;ll be carried right out
to sea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then some vessel will pick us up and
bring us back,&#8221; answered her brother, &#8220;but it
looks now as if we would bring up on Long
Point, and we can walk home from there easy
enough. It&#8217;s only a couple of miles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps we could get home before they
missed us,&#8221; suggested Anne, hopefully.</p>
<p>Amos nodded; he was still busy with the
big fish, but in a few moments he began to look
anxiously ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;The wind&#8217;s pulling round to the southeast,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I guess we sha&#8216;n&#8217;t hit Long Point
after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going right into Wood End,&#8221; declared
Amanda, &#8220;or else to House Point Island.
Oh, Amos, if we land on that island nobody
will ever find us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be better to land anywhere than to
be carried beyond Race Point,&#8221; said Amos; &#8220;the
wind is growing stronger every minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>The three children no longer felt any interest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
in their fish-lines. Amos had drawn his line in
when they started off from shore, and Amanda
had let go of hers when the first oar was lost.
Anne was the only one who had kept a firm
hold on her line, and now she drew it in and
coiled it carefully around the smooth piece of
wood to which it was fastened.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get this boat ashore some way,&#8221; declared
Amos boldly; &#8220;if we run near any land I&#8217;ll
jump overboard with the painter and pull the
dory to shore. I&#8217;ll get up in the bow now so&#8217;s
to be ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neither of the little girls said anything.
Amanda was ready to cry with fear, and Anne
was watching the sky anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sun is all covered up with clouds,&#8221; she
said, and before Amos could answer there came
a patter of raindrops. The wind, too, increased
in force and the waves grew higher. Anne and
Amanda crouched low in the boat, while Amos
in the bow peered anxiously ahead.</p>
<p>Within the curve of the shore of Race Point
lay House Point Island, where Amos hoped they
might land. It was a small island partly covered
with scrubby thickets but no tall trees, and
with shallow water all about it. Amos was sure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
that he could pull the clumsy boat to shore if
the wind would only set a little in that direction.
The September afternoon was growing
late, the sky was now completely overcast, and
the rain falling steadily.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re getting near the island,&#8221; said Amos.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll slide overboard in a minute, and all you
girls need do is keep still till I tell you to
jump,&#8221; and Amos, the painter of the dory in
one hand, slipped over the high bow of the
boat and struck out for shore. He was a strong
swimmer, and managed to change the course of
the boat so that it swung in toward the shallow
water, and in a few minutes Amos got a foothold
on the sand, and pulled strongly on the
rope until the boat was well out of the outward
sweep of the current.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now jump out,&#8221; he commanded; &#8220;you on
one side, Anne, and Amanda on the other, and
take hold of the side and help pull the boat
ashore.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two girls obeyed instantly, and the three
dripping children struggled up the beach, pulling
the dory beyond reach of the tide.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must be sure this boat is safe,&#8221; said
Amos; &#8220;if we can get it up a little further, we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
can tip it up on one side and crawl under and
get out of the rain.&#8221;</p>
<p>The codfish, plaice and flounder Amos took
out carefully and carried to a large rock further
up the beach. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to eat those fish if
we stay here very long,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It grew dark early and the children, under
the shelter of the boat, peered out at the rushing
waves, listened to the wind, and were very glad
that they were on shore, even if it was an island
and miles away from home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody can find us to-night,&#8221; said Anne,
&#8220;but prob&#8217;ly to-morrow morning, first thing,
my Uncle Enos and your father will take a boat
and come sailing right down after us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How will they know where we are?&#8221;
whimpered Amanda. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to stay here
always; I know we shall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we do I&#8217;ll build a brush house,&#8221; said
Amos hopefully, &#8220;and there&#8217;s lots of beach-plums
grow on this island, I&#8217;ve heard folks say;
and we&#8217;ll cook those fish and I&#8217;ll bet I can find
mussels along the shore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t cook anything,&#8221; said Anne, &#8220;for
we can&#8217;t make any fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can make a fire when things get dry,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
said Amos; &#8220;how do you suppose Indians make
fires when they are off like this? An Indian
doesn&#8217;t care where he is because he knows how
to get things to eat and how to cook them, and
how to make a shelter. I&#8217;ve wished lots of
times that I&#8217;d had the chances to learn things
that Indians have.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boat proved a shelter against the wind,
and the long night wore slowly away. Amos
slept soundly, but neither Anne nor Amanda
could sleep, except in short naps from which
they quickly awakened. The storm ceased in
the night and the sun came up and sent its
warm beams down on the shivering children,
who crept out from the dory and ran and
jumped about on the sand until they were quite
warm and very hungry.</p>
<p>Amos went searching along the shore for the
round dark-shelled mussels which he knew
were good to eat, and Anne and Amanda went
up toward the thick-growing bushes beyond
the sand-banks to look for beach-plums.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, Anne! Look! Did you ever see so
many on one bush?&#8221; exclaimed Amanda, and
the bush was indeed well filled with the appetizing
fruit.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We must take a lot to Amos,&#8221; said Anne,
&#8220;for he is getting mussels for us now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; agreed Amanda; &#8220;do you suppose
they will come after us this morning, Anne?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course they will, first thing,&#8221; replied
Anne hopefully, so that Amanda grew more
cheerful, and when they got back to the boat
with aprons full of beach-plums and found
Amos waiting for them with a fine lot of fresh
mussels they quite forgot to be troubled or unhappy.
The sun was shining brightly, the blue
water looked calm and smooth, and the wind
had entirely gone. They ate the plums and
mussels hungrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better look around a little,&#8221; said
Amos, when they had finished, &#8220;and see if we
can find a good place for a brush house. We
ought to build it near the shore so that we can
keep a watch for any passing boat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t father find us to-day?&#8221; asked
Amanda anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t tell,&#8221; replied her brother; &#8220;anyway
we want to get ready to build a house, for we
might have to stay here a week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you want to stay a week, Amos
Cary!&#8221; exclaimed his sister.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d just as soon stay as not,&#8221; said Amos, &#8220;if
I can find some rotten wood like the Indians
use to start a fire; but it isn&#8217;t much use to look
for it until things begin to dry up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amos, followed closely by the little girls,
went up the bank and toward a place where
grew a thicket of small pines. &#8220;We can break
off a lot of these branches and carry them down
to the shore,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and fix some beds of
them under one side of the dory. It will be
better than sleeping on the sand.&#8221;</p>
<p>They made several trips back and forth to the
boat with armfuls of pine boughs until they
each had quite a pile, long and wide enough for
a bed, and high enough to keep them well off
the sand. But Amos was not satisfied.</p>
<p>&#8220;This sand-bank makes a good back for a
house,&#8221; he said; &#8220;now if we could only build
up sides, and fix some kind of a roof, it would
make a fine house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t the dory do for one side?&#8221; asked Anne.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Amos, &#8220;but we can pile up heaps
of sand here on each side of our beds, right
against this sand-bank, and that will make three
sides of a house, and then we&#8217;ll think of something
for the roof.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></p>
<p>So they all went to work piling up the sand.
It was hard work, and it took a long time before
the loose sand could be piled up high enough
for Anne and Amanda to crouch down behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m dreadful hungry,&#8221; said Amanda, after
they had worked steadily for some time; &#8220;let&#8217;s
rest and eat some mussels and beach-plums,&#8221;
and Amos and Anne were both quite ready to
stop work.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be past noon now,&#8221; said Amos,
looking at the sun, &#8220;and there hasn&#8217;t a boat
come in sight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne had begun to look very serious. &#8220;My
Aunt Martha may think that I have run away,&#8221;
she said, as they sat leaning back against the
piles of warm sand.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, she won&#8217;t,&#8221; Amos assured her, &#8220;for
they&#8217;ll find out right off that Amanda and I are
gone, and father&#8217;s dory, and it won&#8217;t take father
or Captain Enos long to guess what&#8217;s happened;
only they&#8217;ll think that we have been carried
out to sea.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little girls were very silent after this,
until Amos jumped up saying: &#8220;I&#8217;ve just
thought of a splendid plan. We&#8217;ll pile up
sand just as high as we can on both sides. Then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
I&#8217;ll take those fish-lines and cut them in pieces
long enough to reach across from one sand heap
to the other, and tie rocks on each end of the
lines and put them across.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think fish-lines will make much of
a roof,&#8221; said Amanda.</p>
<p>&#8220;And after I get the lines across,&#8221; went on
Amos, not heeding what his sister had said,
&#8220;we&#8217;ll lay these pine boughs across the lines.
See? We can have the branches come well over
each side and lap one row over another and
make a fine roof,&#8221; and Amos jumped about,
greatly pleased with his own invention.</p>
<p>They all returned to piling up sand and before
sunset had made walls taller than their
heads, and Amos had put the lines across and
the covering of pine boughs, so that it was nicely
roofed in.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be a lot better than sleeping under
the dory,&#8221; said Anne, as they looked proudly
at the little shelter, &#8220;and there&#8217;s pine boughs
enough left for beds, too!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can get more to-morrow,&#8221; said Amos,
&#8220;and we&#8217;ll have a fire to-morrow if I can only
find some punk, and cook those fish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I want to go home to-morrow,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
Amanda; &#8220;I know my mother wants me.
We&#8217;ve got a boat; can&#8217;t you make an oar and
row us home, Amos?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t anything to make an oar out
of,&#8221; answered Amos.</p>
<p>They made their supper on more mussels and
beach-plums, and then lay down on their beds
of boughs in the little enclosure. They could
see the moon shining over the water, the big
dory hauled up in front of their shelter, and
they all felt very glad that they were not drifting
out at sea.</p>
<p>Amos had many plans in his head, and was
eager for another day to come that he might
carry them out, but Amanda and Anne went to
sleep hoping only that the next day would see
one of the big fishing-boats of Province Town
come sailing up to the island to take them safely
home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THE CASTAWAYS</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;My, it was cold last night,&#8221; shivered
Amanda, as she and Anne went toward the
spring of fresh water which bubbled up near the
shore for their morning drink. &#8220;I do wish
Amos would plan some way to get us home
to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can he?&#8221; asked Anne; &#8220;he hasn&#8217;t any
oars, and see what a long way it is across the
water to Long Point. He couldn&#8217;t swim that
far.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he could, too,&#8221; declared Amanda, &#8220;and
when the tide is out the water is so shallow that
you can see the yellow sand shining through.
He could swim some and walk some, and he&#8217;d
get over there all right; then he could walk
home and tell father and Captain Enos and they
would come right after us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t he go then?&#8221; questioned Anne.
&#8220;I do know that my Aunt Martha is sadly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
worried; it is full two days since we set
forth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Amos likes to stay here,&#8221; said Amanda,
lowering her voice to a whisper; &#8220;he thinks it
is fun to live as Indians do, and he doesn&#8217;t want
to go home. If he gets enough to eat he&#8217;ll stay
and stay, and then he can tell Jimmie Starkweather
of being wrecked on an island.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t we get across to Long Point?&#8221;
asked Anne.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. We can&#8217;t swim, and &#8217;twould be foolish
to try,&#8221; answered Amanda.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have cooked fish for dinner,&#8221; said
Amos as they ate beach-plums for breakfast.
&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I can find some punk somewhere on
this island, and while I am looking for it you
girls gather all the dry twigs you can find, make
a good-sized hole in the sand and fill it up with
dry stuff that will take fire quickly, and I&#8217;ll
show you how Indians cook.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather have some Indian meal mush,&#8221;
replied Amanda; &#8220;can&#8217;t you swim across to
Long Point, Amos, and hurry home and send
some one after us?&#8221;</p>
<p>Amos looked at her in astonishment, and
then smiled broadly. &#8220;I know a better way
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
than that,&#8221; he said, and without waiting to
answer the girl&#8217;s eager questions he ran off
toward the thicket of pines.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll dig the hole in the sand, and then
find some dry wood,&#8221; said Anne; &#8220;anything
cooked will taste good, won&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Amos knows some way to get us home,&#8221;
said Amanda, &#8220;and he&#8217;s got to tell us what it is,
and start just as soon as he cooks his old fish.
I wonder what it is!&#8221;</p>
<p>Now that Amanda saw a prospect of getting
home she felt more cheerful and so did Anne;
and they gathered dry brush, bits of bark and
handfuls of the sunburned beach-grass until the
hole in the sand was filled, and there was a
good-sized heap of dry brush over it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you suppose Amos can really make a
fire?&#8221; asked Anne.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess he can,&#8221; said Amanda. &#8220;Amos is
real smart at queer things like that, that other
boys don&#8217;t think about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve found some!&#8221; shouted Amos, as he
leaped down the bank; &#8220;just a little bit, in the
stump of an old oak tree up here. Now wait
till I get the thole-pins, and you&#8217;ll see,&#8221; and he
ran toward the dory and returned with a pair of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
smooth, round thole-pins, and sat down on the
sand in front of the brush heap. The precious
piece of punk was carefully wrapped in a piece
of the sleeve of his flannel blouse.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had to tear it off,&#8221; he explained, when
Amanda pointed to the ragged slit, &#8220;for punk
must be kept dry or it isn&#8217;t a bit of use.&#8221;</p>
<p>He now spread the bit of flannel on the sand
in front of him, and kneeling down beside it
began to rub the thole-pins across each other as
fast as he could move his hands. Anne and
Amanda, kneeling on each side of him, looked on
with anxious eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a spark!&#8221; at last shouted Amanda.</p>
<p>The spark fell on the dry punk, in an instant
the punk caught and there were several sparks,
then Amos held a wisp of dry grass in front of
it and blew vigorously, and the smouldering
punk flamed up, the grass caught, Amos thrust
it under the dry brush, and in less than a
minute the whole mass was burning briskly.
The children all jumped about it in delight.</p>
<p>&#8220;My, I wish we could have had a fire like
that last night, when I was so cold,&#8221; said
Amanda.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll keep it burning now,&#8221; said Amos.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;ve always wanted to start a fire this way.
I think it&#8217;s better than flint and tinder,&#8221; for in
those days the wooden splint matches were not
known in the settlement, and fires were started
by rubbing flint and steel together until a spark
caught.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going home this afternoon,&#8221; said
Amanda, so firmly that Amos looked at her in
surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s fine
here. We&#8217;ve got a house and a fire, and we&#8217;ll
have fish enough to last&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going home,&#8221; interrupted Amanda;
&#8220;it&#8217;s horrid here, and everybody will be afraid
we are drowned.&#8221;</p>
<p>A little smile crept over Amos&#8217;s freckled face.
&#8220;&#8217;twill indeed be a tale to tell Jimmie Starkweather,&#8221;
he said, looking admiringly at the
brush-covered shelter, and then at the brisk fire.
&#8220;&#8217;Tis a shipwreck such as no boy in the settlement
has had.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amos asked no more questions, but sent the
girls after more dry brush, while he dug another
hole in the sand. Then with a long stick he
pushed the hot wood and coals from the first
hole into the second, and carefully laid the big
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
plaice fish on the hot sand, pushed a thick covering
of hot sand over it, and started a new fire on
top of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;twill be baked to a turn,&#8221; he said to his
sister and Anne; &#8220;&#8217;Tis the way the Indians cook
fish and mussels and clams. I have seen them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go home as soon as we can eat it,&#8221;
said Amanda; &#8220;&#8217;twill be low tide by that time,
and if you have no better plan for us, Amos,
Anne and I will wade to Long Point.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wade!&#8221; repeated Amos scornfully; &#8220;you&#8217;d
be drowned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then tell us your plan,&#8221; urged Amanda,
while Anne looked at him pleadingly. She
had thought much about her father as she lay
awake under the roof of pine boughs, and wondered
if some word from him might not have
reached the settlement. She thought, too, about
the scarlet stockings, and wished herself back in
the little brown house on the hill. So she said,
&#8220;We must go home, Amos.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you girls had stayed home,&#8221; muttered
Amos; &#8220;if some of the boys had come we&#8217;d have
had a good time here; but girls always want to
go home. Well, I&#8217;ll get you to Long Point without
swimming,&#8221; and again Amos smiled, for he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
had a secret of his own that he knew would
greatly surprise Amanda and Anne.</p>
<p>It was not long before he began scraping the
hot embers from the sand under which the fish
was cooking. Then he poked the hot sand
away, and there lay the plaice, steaming and
smoking, and sending out an appetizing odor.</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; said Amos proudly, as he managed
to cut off a piece with his jack-knife for each of
the girls, &#8220;that&#8217;s as good fish as you ever tasted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the best,&#8221; said Anne, and Amanda ate
hungrily. Indeed the children were all so
hungry that they devoured the entire fish.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll stay till to-morrow I&#8217;ll cook the
cod,&#8221; said Amos, but both Amanda and Anne
said they wanted to go home. So Amos with
their help pushed and dragged the dory into the
water, and then telling the girls to stay right by
the boat until he returned, started off up the
beach to where he had found the mussels. In
a few minutes they saw him running back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, Amanda!&#8221; exclaimed Anne, &#8220;he&#8217;s
found an oar!&#8221;</p>
<p>The little girls could hardly believe it possible;
but Amos was smiling and seemed to
think it was a great joke.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I found it yesterday morning, the very first
thing, when you were off after beach-plums,&#8221; he
explained, &#8220;and I hid it, because I knew if I
told you I&#8217;d found an oar you&#8217;d want to start
for home right off; and as long as we were here
I wanted some fun out of it. Now jump in,
and I&#8217;ll scull you over to Long Point in no
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girls were too glad at the idea of really
starting for home to blame Amos for keeping
them on the island so long, but Anne thought
to herself that she was sure that none of the
Starkweather boys would have hidden the oar.
&#8220;Amos is smart, but he&#8217;s selfish,&#8221; she decided,
as the boy bent to the big oar and sent the
clumsy boat toward Long Point.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a good oar, better than the one I lost,&#8221;
said Amos, &#8220;and I do think &#8217;twas lost from one
of the English ships. There&#8217;s a big &#8216;S&#8217; burned
into the handle. Mayhap it belonged to the
&#8216;Somerset.&#8217; If so I&#8217;m glad they lost it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;twas the &#8216;Somerset&#8217; ran down my father&#8217;s
boat and nigh drowned him,&#8221; said Anne, &#8220;and
the sailors lent him no help, but laughed to see
him struggle till he reached near enough their
ship to clamber up.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could be a soldier like your father,&#8221;
said Amos, and at this Anne looked upon him
more kindly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scull faster, Amos,&#8221; urged Amanda; &#8220;the
sun is not two hours high, and &#8217;Tis a long walk
through the sand before we can get home. I do
hope we&#8217;ll get there before milking time that I
may have a drink of warm milk.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the boat touched the sandy shore of
Long Point, Anne and Amanda scrambled over
the bow and urged Amos to hurry.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must make the boat safe,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;&#8217;twould be a sad loss to have the tide take her
out. And I&#8217;ll hide this good oar, too. To-morrow
Jimmie Starkweather and I will sail down
and tow her back, and maybe take a look at the
island,&#8221; and Amos looked back regretfully to
the shores they had just left.</p>
<p>The dory was drawn up beyond reach of the
tide, the oar hidden under the sand, and the
children started on their walk toward home.
The distance was but two miles, but walking
through the loose sand was hard and tiresome.</p>
<p>&#8220;I slip back a step every step I take,&#8221; said
Anne; &#8220;look, the sun is nearly out of sight
now.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The milk will be strained and set ere this,&#8221;
said Amanda mournfully; &#8220;there&#8217;s not even a
beach-plum grows on this point, and the long
grass cuts my feet whenever I come near it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You could have had another baked fish by
this time if you would have stayed on the
island,&#8221; said Amos complainingly.</p>
<p>After this the children plodded on in silence
for a long time. The harvest moon rose beyond
the harbor and smiled down upon them. There
was a silvery glint all over the water, and as
they came round one of the big piles of sand,
which are so often seen along the coast of Cape
Cod, they all stopped and looked out across the
harbor. It was Amos who pointed toward a big
ship riding at anchor, perhaps a mile from the
shore.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the &#8216;Somerset&#8217; back again,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I wonder if there&#8217;s any harm done at the settlement?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>SAFE AT HOME</h3>
</div>

<p>It was late in the evening when the three
tired, hungry children reached the settlement.
Amanda and Amos ran up the path to their
door and Anne plodded on toward Mrs. Stoddard&#8217;s,
nearly a half mile from the Cary house.</p>
<p>There was not a light to be seen in the village,
but Anne could see the shining lanterns on the
&#8220;Somerset&#8221; sending narrow rays of light across
the water. But she was too tired to think of the
British ship, or of anything except how good it
would be to sleep in a real bed again.</p>
<p>At Mrs. Stoddard&#8217;s door she stood for a moment
wondering if she could not creep in and
up-stairs without waking Uncle Enos and Aunt
Martha; she tried the door softly, but it was
bolted, so she rattled the latch and called, &#8220;Aunt
Martha! Uncle Enos!&#8221; a sudden fear filling her
heart that they might not hear her and that she
might have to sleep on the door-step.</p>
<p>But in an instant she heard steps hurrying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
across the kitchen floor, the big bolt was pulled
back, the door swung open, and Anne was
warmly clasped in Aunt Martha&#8217;s arms. Uncle
Enos hurried close behind her, and Anne was
drawn into the kitchen with many exclamations
of wonder and joy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Light a candle that we may look at her,&#8221;
said Aunt Martha, &#8220;and start up a fire. &#8217;Tis a
chilly night, and the child must have some
warm porridge.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not long before the fire was burning
brightly, a kettle of hot water bubbling cheerfully,
that Anne might have a warm bath to
rest and soothe her tired limbs, and Anne, sitting
on Aunt Martha&#8217;s lap, was eating a bowl of hot
porridge and telling the story of her adventures.</p>
<p>&#8220;House Point Island, eh?&#8221; said Uncle Enos;
&#8220;&#8217;Tis lucky there was an island just there, even
so low a one as that. In a hundred years or so
the tides and waves will sweep it away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne told of the brush-covered shelter, of
Amos making a fire and cooking the fish, and
of their journey home, while her kind friends
listened eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We feared the boat had been carried out to
sea and that our little maid was lost,&#8221; said Aunt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
Martha, &#8220;and the men have looked for you all
about the shore. The &#8216;Somerset&#8217; is in harbor
and its crew are doing much mischief on shore, so
that we have had much to disturb us. What a
tangle of hair this is for me to brush out,&#8221; she
added, passing a tender hand over Anne&#8217;s dark
locks.</p>
<p>How good the warm water felt to Anne&#8217;s
bruised feet; and she was sure that nothing ever
tasted so good as the porridge. The rough hair
was brushed into smooth braids, and it was a
very happy little girl who went to sleep in the
upper chamber with her wooden doll beside her,
and the white kitten curled up on the foot of
her bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m not a little Indian girl,&#8221; was
Anne&#8217;s last thought before she went to sleep.</p>
<p>It was late the next morning when she awoke.
Her soiled and torn clothes were not to be seen,
but a dress of clean cotton and a fresh pinafore
lay on the wooden stool.</p>
<p>&#8220;My, it&#8217;s nice to be clean,&#8221; thought Anne,
remembering the uncomfortable efforts that she
and Amanda had made to wash their faces in
water from the island spring.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s near noon, dear child,&#8221; said Mrs. Stoddard,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
as Anne came into the kitchen. &#8220;You
shall have a boiled egg for your breakfast, and I
am cooking a fine johnnycake for you before the
fire. You must be nigh starved. To think of
that Amos Cary hiding the oar instead of fetching
you straight home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he worked all the time to make a house
for us, and to cook the fish,&#8221; explained Anne,
&#8220;and he speaks well of my father. I like him
better than when he called me names.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you do, child; and I did not think
him so smart a boy as he proves. &#8217;twas no
small thing to start a fire as he did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;twas Amanda made him come home,&#8221; said
Anne; &#8220;she told him we would walk through
the water to the Point, and then he said he
would fetch us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Uncle Enos thinks Amos may make a
good sailor,&#8221; said Aunt Martha. &#8220;Indeed, if it
were not for these British ships hovering about
our shores it is likely that Skipper Cary would
have been off to the Banks and taken Amos
with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;Banks&#8221; were the fishing grounds off
the island of Newfoundland, and for several
years the Cape Cod fishermen had made summer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
cruises there, coming home with big cargoes
of fine fish which they sold in the Boston market
at excellent prices. These fishing grounds were
called the &#8220;Banks,&#8221; because of the heavy banks
of fog which settled down in that region.</p>
<p>After Anne had finished her breakfast she
went to Mrs. Stoddard&#8217;s big work-basket, and
took out her knitting-work.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I not knit a long time to-day, Aunt
Martha?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;My feet ache sorely,
and I should like well to knit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is right,&#8221; answered Mrs. Stoddard,
nodding her approval. &#8220;Your Uncle Enos
drove Brownie over the hill where the sailors
from the &#8216;Somerset&#8217; will not be like to see her,
and we will both stay indoors to-day and knit.
Maybe we shall begin to read to-day, also.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After I have knit a good stint,&#8221; said Anne,
&#8220;for &#8217;twill be time for stockings soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a happy morning for the little girl.
She worked steadily and carefully until Captain
Enos came up from the shore for his noon meal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; he said smilingly, &#8220;now this
seems good&mdash;to see our little maid safe at home
by the window with her knitting. I saw Mistress
Starkweather as I came home, and she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
bade me tell you she should walk this way to
see you this afternoon. &#8217;Tis a great day for
Amos,&#8221; continued the captain; &#8220;he tells all
the boys in the village of his great adventure in
rounding Long Point and living two days on an
island. You&#8217;d think he&#8217;d seen Terra del Fuego,
to say the least.&#8221;</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<a name='linki_3' id='linki_3'></a>
<img src='images/illus-116.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 311px; height: 464px;' /><br />
<p class='captionc' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 311px;'>
SHE WORKED STEADILY<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;And what is Terra del Fuego?&#8221; asked
Anne wonderingly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a far island, Anne, in warm southern
seas, such a distance as few Cape Cod sailors
ever go; though we go to most places, I will
say,&#8221; he added with a hearty laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amos and Jimmie Starkweather were all for
sailing off this morning to bring the dory home,&#8221;
he continued, &#8220;but a boatload of the &#8216;Somerset&#8217;s&#8217;
men stopped them and sent them ashore, threatening
to dismast any sloop that put up a sail in
this harbor without their permission.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne knit steadily on, thinking of her father,
and wondering if these men on board the &#8220;Somerset&#8221;
had any knowledge of him. But she asked
no questions, knowing that Captain Enos would
tell her if any news came.</p>
<p>The scarlet stockings had made good progress
when Mistress Starkweather was seen coming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
up the sandy path. Anne ran to the door to
meet her, and the good woman kissed her heartily.
&#8220;To think of the danger you were in, dear
child,&#8221; she said, as Anne led her into the sunny
kitchen and drew out the most comfortable chair
for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amos was not afraid,&#8221; said Anne, &#8220;but
Amanda and I did wish ourselves home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll warrant that boy would not be afraid
of the water, storm or no storm,&#8221; said Mrs. Stoddard,
drawing her own chair near to her neighbor&#8217;s;
&#8220;yet Captain Enos tells that he fled from
our Anne here when she threw water at him,&#8221;
and the two women smiled, remembering the
little girl&#8217;s loyal defense of her absent father.</p>
<p>&#8220;School is to begin next Monday, if all goes
well,&#8221; continued Mrs. Starkweather, &#8220;and beside
that the minister declared we must all come
more punctually to church. Last Sunday there
were but seven in the meeting-house,&#8221; and Mrs.
Starkweather&#8217;s face grew sober.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not have time to learn to read long
words before Monday,&#8221; said Anne anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I planned to teach the child a little before
school begins,&#8221; explained Mrs. Stoddard,
&#8220;from Captain Enos&#8217;s &#8216;Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress.&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
His mother bought the book in Boston, and he
treasures it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And no wonder,&#8221; replied Mrs. Starkweather;
&#8220;beside the Bible there are few books in any
household in the settlement. I doubt if the
minister can lay claim to a half dozen. He has
his knowledge in his head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And so should all people have,&#8221; said Mrs.
Stoddard. &#8220;Anne, go to the big red chest in
my bedroom and take out the book that lays
there and fetch it to me. Mayhap Mistress
Starkweather would like to see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne quickly obeyed. The big red chest was
one that Captain Enos had carried when he
went on whaling voyages. It had handles of
twisted rope, and a huge padlock swung from
an iron loop in front. Anne lifted the top and
reached in after the book; but the chest was
deep; there were only a few articles on the
bottom of the chest, and she could not reach it.
So she pushed the lid back until it rested against
the wall, and stepped into the chest, stooping
down to pick up the book. As she leaned over,
bang,&mdash;down came the lid to the chest, shutting
Anne closely in. For an instant the child was
too frightened to move, as she lay on her face in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
the big chest; then she tried to sit up, and found
she could not. She tried to call &#8220;Aunt Martha,&#8221;
but her voice sounded thick and muffled.</p>
<p>In the kitchen the two neighbors sat waiting
for Anne and the book.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anne! Anne!&#8221; called Mrs. Stoddard.
&#8220;Why, the child is usually so spry. I wonder
what keeps her,&#8221; and she went into the bedroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Anne slip out while we talked?&#8221; she
called back to Mrs. Starkweather. &#8220;She&#8217;s not
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just then there came a sound from the chest.
&#8220;Pity&#8217;s sake!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Stoddard. &#8220;I
do believe Anne is in the chest,&#8221; and she hastened
to swing back the big lid and to lift the
half-stifled child out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever!&#8221; she said. &#8220;How came you
in the chest, child?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I got in to get the book and the lid fell on
me,&#8221; half whispered Anne, clinging to Mrs.
Stoddard&#8217;s skirts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, child, there is no harm done,&#8221;
said Mrs. Stoddard, &#8220;but &#8217;Tis not a safe thing to
get into chests. I will get the book. I thought
your arms were longer,&#8221; and Mrs. Stoddard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
reached into the sea-chest and drew out a long
black-covered book. &#8220;It has many pictures,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I wonder I have not shown it to
Anne before.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Starkweather looked at the book admiringly,
and Mrs. Stoddard took Anne in her
lap that they might all enjoy the pictures together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; she said; &#8220;here is Christian setting
forth on his journey, and here are Obstinate and
Pliable, two of his neighbors, following him to
urge him to come home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne looked at the picture eagerly. She had
never seen pictures in a book before, and it
seemed very wonderful to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a good story,&#8221; said Mrs. Starkweather.
&#8220;True, it is said to be but a dream, but I read it
in my youth and liked it well. It has been a
treat to see it, Mrs. Stoddard. &#8217;Tis seldom I
have so care-free an afternoon. Six boys to look
after keep me busy,&#8221; and the good woman rose
from her chair and with cordial words of good-bye
started for home.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could read this book,&#8221; said Anne,
turning the leaves over carefully and wondering
what the pictures meant.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So you shall. We&#8217;ll read a little now.
Come, you shall spell out the words, and I
will speak them for you and tell you their
meaning.&#8221;</p>
<p>An hour later when Captain Enos stepped
into the kitchen he declared that he thought
school had begun there; and while Mrs. Stoddard
hurried about to prepare supper Uncle Enos
continued Anne&#8217;s reading lesson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I can read this book after I go to
school,&#8221; said Anne.</p>
<p>&#8220;That you can,&#8221; answered the captain.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I will learn to write,&#8221; said Anne, &#8220;and
it may be I could send a letter to my dear
father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a good child,&#8221; said Captain Enos,
patting the dark head; &#8220;learn to write and
we&#8217;ll set about starting the letter to your father
as soon as you have it ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall have much to tell him,&#8221; said Anne,
smiling up into Uncle Enos&#8217;s kind face.</p>
<p>&#8220;And he&#8217;ll have a good deal to tell you,&#8221;
replied Captain Enos. &#8220;I wish I could see him
myself. I&#8217;d like news of what&#8217;s going on in
Boston.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>CAPTAIN ENOS&#8217;S SECRETS</h3>
</div>

<p>The playhouse under the pines was almost
forgotten as the days grew colder, and the fall
rains came, with high winds; and Anne&#8217;s scarlet
stocking was now long enough for Aunt Martha
to &#8220;set the heel&#8221; and begin to shape the foot.
School had begun in Elder Haven&#8217;s sitting-room,
with fourteen scholars, and Anne was learning
to write.</p>
<p>&#8220;Master Haven says I write my own name
nicely,&#8221; she said at the end of the first week,
&#8220;and that by the time school closes he thinks
I can write a letter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Enos nodded approvingly. He and
Anne were sitting before a bright fire of driftwood
in the pleasant kitchen, while Mrs. Stoddard
had gone to Mrs. Starkweather&#8217;s for more
scarlet yarn. Anne was knitting busily; her
wooden doll sat on the floor, and the white kitten
was curled up close to the little girl&#8217;s feet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
Captain Enos had several pieces of smooth cedar
wood on a stool near his chair, and was at work
upon one with his sharp jack-knife.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; he said, looking up from his
whittling. &#8220;That will please thy father, Anne.
And learn as fast as you can, for I see a fair
chance of sending a letter to Boston, when
one is ready; and then thy father could soon
get it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Uncle Enos!&#8221; exclaimed Anne, &#8220;if
there be a chance to send a letter could you not
write for me? It may be when I can write
there will be no chance to send a letter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Enos nodded. &#8220;You are a wise
child,&#8221; he said. &#8220;My writing isn&#8217;t the plainest
in the world, but I&#8217;ll do my best. I have some
sheets of good smooth paper in my sea-chest,
and a good quill pen, too. Elder Haven fixed
the pen for me from the feather of a wild goose
I killed on the marshes last spring. But I do
not think there is such a thing as ink in the
house; but I can make a fair ink with the juice
of the elderberry and a fair lot of soot from the
chimney. So think up what you wish to tell
your father, Anne, and if it storms to-morrow
we&#8217;ll write the letter.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How will you send it, Uncle Enos?&#8221; asked
Anne, forgetting to knit and turning eager eyes
toward the captain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sshh!&#8221; said Captain Enos. &#8220;&#8217;Tis a secret&mdash;hardly
to be whispered. But there is a good-hearted
sailorman on board the British ship.
We have had some talk together on the shore,
and he told me that he liked thy father; and
that he did not blame him for escaping from
the ship.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne nodded smilingly, and reached down
and picked up her wooden doll.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has the sailorman any little girl?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;That he has,&#8221; said Captain Enos. &#8220;He
told me that he had two small maids of his own
in Plymouth, England, far across the ocean;
and he asked if I knew aught of John Nelson&#8217;s
little girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s me!&#8221; said Anne, holding the wooden
doll tight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Captain Enos, &#8220;and he said that
he might find a chance to send some word to
thy father that you were a good and happy
child. Then I told him, Anne, that you
planned to write a letter, and he said he&#8217;d take
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
it to Boston, and then &#8217;twould soon reach thy
father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could hear the sailorman speak of
my father,&#8221; said Anne, &#8220;and tell me of his little
girls in England.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mayhap you can, child. He comes ashore
after water each day. A stout man he is, with
reddish hair and good honest blue eyes. He
tells me his name is William Trull. If you see
such a man you may speak to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Enos! That is the sailorman who
saved me from the Indian women, and brought
me safe home,&#8221; exclaimed Anne. &#8220;Do you not
remember?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I do, Anne. And I thought the
name would mean something to you,&#8221; replied
Captain Enos.</p>
<p>Anne smiled happily. It was good news to
hear from the sailorman, and to know that he
was a friend of her father&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you making, Uncle Enos?&#8221; asked
Anne, as the captain put down one smooth bit
of wood and picked up another.</p>
<p>Captain Enos pointed to Anne&#8217;s wooden
doll and whispered, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid Martha Stoddard
Nelson will hear. Put her down behind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
your chair and come over here, and I&#8217;ll tell
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne set the doll down carefully, with its
head turned away from Captain Enos, and tiptoed
across the little space between them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m making a chair for Martha Stoddard
Nelson,&#8221; whispered Captain Enos, &#8220;for a surprise.
And you mustn&#8217;t tell her a word about
it till it is all ready for her to sit in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne laughed. To have a secret with Uncle
Enos was about the most delightful thing she
could imagine; and to have it mean a fine cedar
chair for her doll to sit in was the best kind of
a secret.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t let Martha Stoddard Nelson
face toward me more than you can help,&#8221; went
on Uncle Enos. &#8220;You don&#8217;t think she has
noticed what I am doing, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; whispered Anne. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be very careful,
and let her stay up-stairs a good deal until
the chair is finished.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That will be a good plan,&#8221; said Uncle Enos,
&#8220;and there comes your Aunt Martha. I hear
her at the door.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne ran to open the door and Mrs. Stoddard
came in smiling and rosy from her walk in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
sharp wind. The white kitten jumped up and
came running toward her, and the good woman
looked about the cheerful room as if she thought
it the finest place in the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have more scarlet yarn,&#8221; she said, sitting
down near Captain Enos, &#8220;and I have a present
for thee, Anne; something that Mistress Starkweather
sent thee with her love,&#8221; and Mrs.
Stoddard handed Anne a small package.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a box!&#8221; declared the little girl, taking
off the paper in which it was wrapped, &#8220;and
see how sweet it smells.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis of sandalwood,&#8221; said Captain Enos.
&#8220;There must be many such in the settlement,
for &#8217;twas but a few years ago that some of our
men came back from a voyage to Ceylon, and
fetched such boxes in their chests.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Open it, Anne,&#8221; said Mrs. Stoddard, and
Anne carefully took off the cover.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, look!&#8221; she exclaimed, holding out the
box toward Aunt Martha; &#8220;what are these
shining things; all pink and round?&#8221; and she
picked up a string of pink coral beads and held
them up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coral beads!&#8221; said Aunt Martha. &#8220;Mistress
Starkweather said that she thought when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
her husband brought them home she would
keep them for a little girl of her own; but since
she has but six boys, she says she knows of no
little girl to whom she would rather give them
than to thee, Anne. And you must go down
to-morrow before school begins and thank her
properly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Coral beads!&#8221; repeated Anne, holding up
the pink beads and touching them softly.
&#8220;May I put them around my neck, Aunt
Martha?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed you may, child. See, here is a clasp
of bright gold to hold them,&#8221; and Mrs. Stoddard
fastened the beads around Anne&#8217;s neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a fine gift,&#8221; said Captain Enos admiringly,
&#8220;and shows a kind heart in Mistress
Starkweather.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish my father could see,&#8221; said Anne.
&#8220;When he knows about my scarlet stockings
and leather shoes, and the white kitten, and
that I go to school and have coral beads, he will
think I am the luckiest girl in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will write him all that,&#8221; said Captain
Enos.</p>
<p>Just then the wooden latch of the kitchen
door rattled and the door swung open.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Amanda!&#8221; exclaimed Anne, and
Amanda Cary stepped inside and carefully
closed the door behind her.</p>
<p>&#8220;See, Amanda!&#8221; exclaimed Anne happily,
&#8220;I have had a fine present. Mistress Starkweather
gave me these,&#8221; and she touched the
pink beads, &#8220;and this!&#8221; and she pointed to the
sweet-smelling box of sandalwood.</p>
<p>Amanda&#8217;s thin face brightened. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got
some coral beads just like yours,&#8221; she said; &#8220;my
father got them &#8217;way off across the ocean. When
I grow older and times are better, my mother
says I shall have a white dress and can wear my
coral beads then.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two little girls played with the doll and
kitten and Captain Enos kept on with his work.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I had a doll,&#8221; he heard Amanda say.
&#8220;I have asked Amos to make me one, but he is
not clever at whittling out things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Enos nodded to himself smilingly.
Since Anne and Amos and Amanda had been
carried down the harbor to House Point Island
together, and he had heard how pleasant
Amanda had been to Anne, he had liked the
Cary children better, and had quite forgiven
their old-time teasing ways. After Amanda
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
had started for home he called Anne to him
and said, &#8220;I have another secret!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; said Anne, with a gay little laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like to make Amanda Cary a
present?&#8221; he questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not give her my doll,&#8221; answered
Anne, her bright face growing sober. &#8220;&#8217;Tis all
I have that my father made.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if I make another doll, a fine wooden
doll, as near like yours as I can, would you like
to give that to Amanda?&#8221; asked Uncle Enos.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes! Yes, indeed,&#8221; said Anne, the
smiles all coming back again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then &#8217;Tis a secret till I have the doll finished,&#8221;
said Captain Enos; &#8220;then maybe you
can make a dress for it, and give it to Amanda,
just as she gave you her white kitten.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne was very happy over this secret; it
seemed even better than the new wooden chair
for Martha Stoddard Nelson.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never gave anybody a present,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;but I know it must be the finest thing in the
world to give somebody a gift,&#8221; and she looked
up into Uncle Enos&#8217;s kindly face questioningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a good child, Anne,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
I will make the wooden doll as soon as time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
offers. Now take thy beads and box and Martha
Stoddard Nelson to thy room, and I will bring
in some wood for Aunt Martha. Then &#8217;twill be
time for a bite of supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne carried her treasures up-stairs to the
little room. There was a stand in the room
now, one that had belonged to her father. It
had two drawers, and in one of them Anne carefully
put the sandalwood box with the pink
coral beads.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I have more lovely things than any
little girl,&#8221; she said to herself, as she slowly
closed the drawer. &#8220;There&#8217;s my doll, and my
white kitten, and my scarlet stockings, which I
shall have finished to-morrow, and my leather
shoes, and these coral beads and the box!&#8221;
But Anne gave a little sigh and then whispered,
&#8220;And if my dear father could only know all
about them, and that I am to give a doll to
Amanda.&#8221; She looked out of the small window
toward the beautiful harbor, and wished that
she might go sailing over it to Boston, to find
her father and bring him safe to Province Town.
&#8220;I wish King George knew how much trouble
he was making with his old war-ships,&#8221; Anne
whispered to the wooden doll.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I have a fine dish of ink all ready,&#8221; said
Captain Enos the next morning, &#8220;but &#8217;Tis too
clear a morning to sit in the house and write
letters. There are good cod coming into the
harbor, and I must row out and catch what I
can while the weather is good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can we not write the letter to-night?&#8221; asked
Anne. &#8220;Aunt Martha has some fine pitch
knots to burn that will make the kitchen light
as day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see, come night,&#8221; replied Captain
Enos.</p>
<p>The two were walking down the sandy path
together,&mdash;Captain Enos bound for the shore,
and Anne started for Mistress Starkweather&#8217;s to
thank her for the coral beads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be a good child,&#8221; said Captain Enos, as he
turned from the path and left Anne to go on
alone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></p>
<p>As the little girl came near the spring, she
saw a man rolling a water cask toward it, and
toward the shore she could see several other
men, whom she knew came from the British
ship. She looked closely at the man at the
spring, and as she passed near him, noticed that
his hair was red. He smiled and nodded as
Anne went by, and then she saw that he had
pleasant blue eyes, and she stopped and said:
&#8220;Have you forgotten the little girl you saved
from the Indians?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed!&#8221; replied the big man heartily;
&#8220;and so you are John Nelson&#8217;s little girl. And
you are not afraid of a Britisher?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; said Anne, in surprise; &#8220;you have
two little maids in England.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That I have, safe with their mother. But
I should like well to see their bright faces, and
your father would like to see you, child. You
do not forget him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Anne soberly. &#8220;We plan to write
him a letter for you to take.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Speak not so loud,&#8221; cautioned the man;
&#8220;the other sailors may hear. And get your
letter ready soon, for, come a fair wind, we&#8217;ll be
off up the coast again to Boston Harbor.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do your little girls write you letters?&#8221;
asked Anne.</p>
<p>The big man shook his head. &#8220;No, they are
not yet taught to write,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It may be
I&#8217;ll be sailing back come spring, and then I&#8217;ll
tell them about the little maid I saw in Province
Town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell them my name is Anne,&#8221; said she
eagerly. &#8220;I wish I could go to Boston and find
my father. I must hurry now, but I wish I
knew the names of your little girls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They have good names,&#8221; said the big man.
&#8220;Each one is named for a grandmother. One
is Betsey and the other Hannah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll remember,&#8221; said Anne, and she said
&#8220;Good-bye&#8221; and went quickly on toward Mrs.
Starkweather&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do wish I could go and find my father,&#8221;
she thought as she walked along. &#8220;I know
he&#8217;d like to see me better than a letter. I
wish I had asked William Trull to take me in
the big ship. But maybe Aunt Martha would
not wish me to ask him.&#8221;</p>
<p>All day Anne thought about the letter that
Captain Enos had promised to write for her;
and when supper was over and the kitchen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
began to grow dusky with the shadows of the
October evening, she ran out to the little shed
and came tugging in a big root of pine.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I put this on the fire, Aunt Martha?&#8221;
she asked, &#8220;that Uncle Enos may see to write?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tis a pine knot,&#8221; said Mrs. Stoddard. &#8220;We
shall need many such for light and heat before
the long winter goes. But put it on, child.
&#8217;Tis a good plan to write thy father.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pine knot blazed up brightly, and Captain
Enos drew the table near the open fire, and,
with Anne perched on a high stool beside him,
and Mrs. Stoddard busy with her knitting,
while the white kitten purred happily from its
comfortable place under her chair, the letter
was begun. Word for word, just as Anne told
him, Captain Enos wrote down about the stockings
and shoes, the school and the kitten, the
pink beads and William Trull, and at last Anne
said: &#8220;That is all, only that I want to see him
and that I love him well,&#8221; and Captain Enos
finished the letter, and Anne went up-stairs to
bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a plan to take a cargo of fish to Boston,
Martha,&#8221; said Captain Enos, as soon as
Anne had gone. &#8220;The &#8216;Somerset&#8217; will sail on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
the first fair wind. I can fill the sloop with
good cod by the time she is out of gunshot; and
I&#8217;ll venture to say they will bring a good price
in Boston Town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how can you make safe landing there,
Enos?&#8221; asked his wife anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll manage,&#8221; replied the captain smilingly,
&#8220;and it may be I can get some news of Anne&#8217;s
father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twould be a brave cruise,&#8221; said Mrs. Stoddard.
&#8220;I should like well to go with thee,
Enos.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Enos laughed heartily. &#8220;And so
would Anne, I dare say,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Maybe
when spring comes and the British have been
sent home I&#8217;ll take you and Anne to Boston on
a pleasure trip. If I get a good price for my
fish, I&#8217;ll bring you home a warm shawl,
Martha.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mind not about me, Enos, but get some good
wool cloth, if you see the chance, to make Anne
a dress. She likes bright colors, and the Freemans
will tell you where to purchase, and you
may see some plaid or figured stuff that has
good wearing in it. Three yards of good width
will be a plenty.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s but little trading in Boston these
days,&#8221; replied Captain Enos; &#8220;there&#8217;s a blight
on the land, until we can make England give us
fairer treatment. I do believe &#8217;twill come to
open war in Boston.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they talked, Captain Enos was busy shaping
the wooden doll which Anne was to give
Amanda.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must finish this before I begin to plan for
Boston,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What did we do for pleasure,
Martha, before Anne came to live with us?
Why, we had not even a white kitten. And
&#8217;twas little enough I thought of whittling out
dolls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or I of knitting scarlet stockings,&#8221; answered
his wife. &#8220;Anne knits her stint each day, and
will soon have hers done, but her second pair I
am knitting for the child. November is close at
hand, and then she must be warmly clad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her leather shoes are ready,&#8221; said Captain
Enos, with a satisfied nod.</p>
<p>The next morning Captain Enos gave the letter
to William Trull, who promised to find a
chance of forwarding it to John Nelson.</p>
<p>&#8220;What think you, Anne?&#8221; said Mrs. Stoddard
when the little girl came home from school
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
that day. &#8220;The &#8216;Somerset&#8217; is getting under
way, and your Uncle Enos says &#8217;Tis like enough
that your father will have the letter before the
week ends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could see him read it,&#8221; said Anne.</p>
<p>&#8220;And your Uncle Enos has a bold plan, child.
He is filling up his sloop with fine cod to take
to the Boston market, and if this wind holds,
he will go sailing up the coast to-morrow morning.
Mayhap he&#8217;ll be in Boston before the
&#8216;Somerset.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they will fire their big guns at him and
sink the sloop!&#8221; said Anne fearfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your uncle will not give them a chance,&#8221; answered
Mrs. Stoddard. &#8220;He will put in and out
among the islands and keep out of their sight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May I not go with him, Aunt Martha? I
could see my father then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Stoddard shook her head. &#8220;&#8217;Twould not
be wise, child. Your uncle would not wish it.
There would be but little chance of finding your
father. Your uncle plans to make but a short
stay and get home as soon as may be. It is no
time to be coasting about, with British ships
ready to sink any craft they see. Here, see!&#8221;
and she held something up in her hand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Amanda&#8217;s doll!&#8221; exclaimed Anne, &#8220;and
you have made a fine dress for her. Can I take
it down now?&#8221; and the little girl took the
wooden doll which Captain Enos had whittled
out and looked at it admiringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, run along,&#8221; replied Mrs. Stoddard;
&#8220;&#8217;twill be a great surprise for Amanda.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne hurried down the hill and along the
shore toward the Cary house, holding the doll
carefully under the little shawl of gay plaid
which Mrs. Stoddard had pinned about her
shoulders. The sand no longer felt warm about
her bare feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be wearing my new stockings and
shoes soon,&#8221; she thought, as her feet felt the cold
dampness.</p>
<p>Amanda saw her coming and ran out to meet
her, a white kitten close at her heels.</p>
<p>&#8220;See, the British ship is going!&#8221; exclaimed
Amanda, and the two little girls turned and
watched the big ship under full sail moving off
across the harbor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amanda,&#8221; said Anne, &#8220;you know you gave
me the nice white kitten?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Amanda; &#8220;has it run away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no; it is just as contented as can be,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
said Anne; &#8220;only ever since you gave it to me
I have wished I could give you something.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amanda&#8217;s face flushed and she dug her bare
toes into the sand. She was remembering how
unkind she and Amos had been to Anne, and was
wishing that Anne would not thank her for the
kitten.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now I have a present for you,&#8221; went on
Anne, taking the wooden doll from beneath the
little plaid shawl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your doll!&#8221; exclaimed Amanda in surprise.</p>
<p>Anne shook her head smilingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, &#8220;your doll. See, it is new.
And it is larger than mine. Take it,&#8221; for
Amanda&#8217;s hands were behind her, as if she did
not mean to take the gift.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s yours. Uncle Enos made it, and Aunt
Martha made the dress,&#8221; and Anne held the
doll toward her friend.</p>
<p>Then Amanda&#8217;s hands unclasped and reached
forward eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fine doll,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I do think,
Anne, it is full handsomer than yours. Come,
that I may show it to my mother. I shall name
it for you, Anne. I have already named it. I
shall call it Lovely Anne Nelson. Indeed I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
shall. I never had a gift before.&#8221; And Amanda
held the doll tight and smiled happily at Anne,
as she reached out to draw her into the house
that Mrs. Cary might see the doll.</p>
<p>When Anne started for home, Amanda walked
along beside her for a little way. When they
neared the spring she put her arm about Anne&#8217;s
neck and kissed her on the cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; she exclaimed; &#8220;now you know
how dear you are. I was bad to you, Anne
Nelson, right here at this very spring; and I
set Amos on to tease you. And now you have
given me a gift.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you gave me the kitten,&#8221; answered
Anne, &#8220;and I chased you away from the spring
with sand and water.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But now we like each other well,&#8221; said
Amanda. &#8220;You like me now, Anne?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the little girl; &#8220;I would not
give you a gift if I did not like you well,&#8221; and
the two little girls smiled at each other happily
and parted, Amanda to run home to her doll,
while Anne went more slowly up the hill, thinking
of the trip Uncle Enos was about to make
and wishing that she could go with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could wear my scarlet stockings and new
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
shoes for my father to see,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;and
I would be no trouble to Uncle Enos. There
are two bunks in the sloop&#8217;s cabin, and I would
be company for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The more Anne thought about this cruise to
Boston the more she longed to go. Captain
Enos was late to his supper that night.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a fine cargo of fish,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I
shall go out on the morning tide, before you are
awake, little maid,&#8221; with a nod to Anne. &#8220;Next
spring you and Aunt Martha shall go with me
and see the fine town of Boston, with its shops
and great houses. The British soldiers will be
gone by that time, and it may be we will have
our own government. There will be good days
for us all then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to go now,&#8221; said Anne, and Captain
Enos laughed and shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Run away to bed now, child,&#8221; said Aunt
Martha, as soon as the supper dishes were
washed, &#8220;and take these stockings up-stairs
with you. I toed off the last one while you
were at Amanda Cary&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Anne said good-night, and Captain Enos
gave her a good-bye kiss, telling her to take
good care of her Aunt Martha while he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
away, and went slowly up-stairs. But she did
not undress and go to bed. She sat down on
the little wooden stool, her mind full of a great
resolve. She sat there quietly until she heard
Captain Enos and Mrs. Stoddard go to bed.
Then she moved softly to the little table under
which stood her new shoes. Taking these and
her scarlet stockings, she crept softly down the
stairs. Crossing the kitchen gently, she slid
back the bolt, and let herself out into the night.</p>
<p>There was a fresh wind from the southwest,
and the little girl shivered a little as she ran
toward the shore. The sloop was anchored some
little distance from shore; Captain Enos would
row out in his dory to her. As Anne reached
the shore and looked out at the sloop she almost
lost courage.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how I can ever get out there
without a boat,&#8221; she exclaimed aloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out there?&#8221; the voice sounded close at her
elbow, and Anne gave a jump and looked around.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want to get out to Captain
Enos&#8217;s boat for?&#8221; asked Jimmie Starkweather.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jimmie!&#8221; exclaimed the little girl,
&#8220;what are you doing down on the shore in the
night?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Night! Why, it&#8217;s not much after dark,&#8221;
answered the boy. &#8220;Father has been out fishing
all day, and I have just pulled the dory up,
and was going home when I heard you. What
do you want to go out to the sloop for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmie, my father is in Boston and I do
want to see him,&#8221; said Anne. &#8220;Captain Enos
is going to sail early to-morrow morning for
Boston, and I want to go out and sleep in the
cabin to-night. Then I will keep as quiet as I
can till he is nearly in Boston, and then I will
tell him all about it, and he will take me to see
my father.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmie shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t Captain Enos want you to go?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;He says I may go next spring,&#8221; answered
Anne, &#8220;but if you row me out to the sloop,
Jimmie, &#8217;twould be no harm. You could tell
Aunt Martha to-morrow, and I would soon be
home. But &#8217;Tis a long time since I saw my
father. You see yours every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a little sob in Anne&#8217;s throat and
Jimmie wondered if she was going to cry. He
hoped she wouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jump into the dory,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
good lesson from my father, I&#8217;ll warrant, for
this; but jump in. And mind you tell Captain
Enos that I told you to go home, but that you
would not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Jimmie,&#8221; said Anne, putting her shoes
and stockings into the boat, and then climbing
in herself. The boy sprang in after her, pushed
off the dory, and in a short time had reached the
sloop.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now go straight to the cabin and shut the
door,&#8221; cautioned Jimmie, and Anne obeyed,
creeping into the top bunk and pulling a rough
blanket over her.</p>
<p>She heard the sound of Jimmie&#8217;s oars, as he
pulled toward shore, felt the motion of the tide,
as the big sloop rose and fell, and soon was
asleep and dreaming that her father and William
Trull were calling her a brave little maid.</p>
<p>Jimmie had many misgivings after he reached
shore, and made up his mind to go straight to
Captain Stoddard and tell him of Anne&#8217;s plan.
Then he remembered that Anne had trusted
him with her secret. &#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll have to let
her go,&#8221; he decided.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>ANNE FINDS HER FATHER</h3>
</div>

<p>It was just daybreak when Captain Enos,
carrying a basket of provisions for his cruise,
made his way to the shore and pushed off his
dory.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a soul stirring,&#8221; he said, as he stepped
aboard the sloop, fastened the dory, which he
intended to tow, and then carried the basket of
food to the little cabin.</p>
<p>As he pushed open the door Anne awoke, but
she did not stir, and Captain Enos did not look
in the direction of the upper bunk. She heard
him hoisting the big mainsail, then came the
rattle of the anchor chain, the sloop swung
round, and Anne knew that at last she was
really on her way to find her father.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must keep very still,&#8221; she whispered to
herself, &#8220;or Uncle Enos might &#8217;bout ship and
sail straight back to Province Town,&#8221; so she did
not move, though she wished very much that
she might be out on deck with Captain Enos,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
feeling the salt breeze on her cheeks and enjoying
the sail. She knew by the way the sloop
tipped that they were going very fast. &#8220;Seems
as if it was sailing right on its side,&#8221; thought
Anne; &#8220;if it tips much more I do believe I&#8217;ll
slide out of this berth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A fine wind, a fine wind!&#8221; Captain Enos
said with a satisfied nod, as his boat went flying
along; &#8220;I&#8217;ll make Boston Harbor before nightfall
at this rate, in time to get my fish ashore
by dusk, if I can slide into a landing without
the British stopping me. My cargo will be welcome,&#8221;
and Captain Enos smiled to himself as
he thought of the praise he would get from his
friends and acquaintance for his brave venture
in such troublous times.</p>
<p>Toward noon Anne carefully let herself down
from the bunk, and peered out through the
door, which Captain Enos had left open. She
could see the low sandy shores of Cape Cod, and
here and there a white-sailed boat. &#8220;I guess
we must be &#8217;most to Boston,&#8221; she thought; &#8220;the
sun is way up in the middle of the sky, and I
am so hungry.&#8221; She came a little nearer to the
cabin door and put her head out. &#8220;Uncle
Enos!&#8221; she said softly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></p>
<p>But the captain was singing to keep himself
company, and did not hear the faint voice. His
head was turned a little away from Anne, but
just as she was about to call again his song
came to an end and he turned his glance ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless my soul!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is I, Uncle Enos!&#8221; said Anne, stepping
out of the cabin.</p>
<p>The captain was almost too surprised to speak.
Anne clambered along the side of the sloop
until she was close beside him, and reaching
out took fast hold of his rough coat sleeve, and
repeated:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is I, Uncle Enos.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where on earth did you come from?&#8221; he
exclaimed.</p>
<p>Anne pointed toward the cabin.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you get there?&#8221; questioned Captain
Enos. &#8220;Weren&#8217;t you abed and asleep when
I left the house this morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Uncle Enos,&#8221; said Anne, creeping a little
closer; &#8220;I slept in the top bunk in the sloop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this is a nice affair. I can&#8217;t take you
back now. I&#8217;ll make Boston Harbor before
dusk with this wind. But how came you in the
sloop?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmie Starkweather rowed me out last
night after you were sound asleep. And he is
going to tell Aunt Martha all about it this
morning. He told me to tell you that he didn&#8217;t
want me to go aboard, but that I would,&#8221; said
Anne.</p>
<p>Captain Enos&#8217;s face was very sober, but he
did not say any harsh word.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you hide in the sloop for, child?&#8221;
he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;To go to Boston with you, Uncle Enos, and
find my father,&#8221; said Anne.</p>
<p>Then the captain&#8217;s face grew even more sober.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you do not like living with us?&#8221; he
said; &#8220;but I thought you seemed happy, Anne.
Your Aunt Martha will miss you, child. But
if your heart is so set on being with your father
I must do my best to find him for you. How a
soldier can manage to care for a small girl like
you is more than I can tell,&#8221; and the captain
sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I brought my scarlet stockings and new
shoes to show him,&#8221; said Anne.</p>
<p>Captain Enos nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I can tell him about my kitten and the
coral beads, and about going to school.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Did you not bring the coral beads?&#8221; asked
the captain.</p>
<p>Anne shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I heard you tell
Aunt Martha that you would be away but a day
or two, and I thought I could tell my father
about the beads.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you mean to go home with me?&#8221;
asked the captain, a little smile creeping about
his mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; said Anne. &#8220;I do but want to
see my father and tell him all the pleasant
things that have befallen me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; said Captain Enos, &#8220;now I
must scold you, Anne. Your Aunt Martha will
not be pleased at this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you are not angry?&#8221; asked Anne. &#8220;I
do see little wrinkles about your eyes that mean
you will soon smile. And it is long since I
have seen my father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must make the best of it now,&#8221; said the
captain, &#8220;but I do blame the Starkweather boy
for setting you out to the sloop. He should
have sent you straight home, and let me know
of your plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne looked at Captain Enos in surprise.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmie could not help my coming,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;I should have found some way to get to
the sloop. And he would not tell a secret.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you did not mean to run away from us?&#8221;
said Captain Enos. &#8220;I am glad of that, but
how I will manage with you in Boston I know
not, nor if I can find your father.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Enos&#8217;s sloop ran safely in among the
islands, sailed across Boston Harbor without being
noticed, and made fast at a wharf well
known to Captain Enos, and where he was welcomed
by an old acquaintance. Before dusk he
had sold his cargo of fish at a good price, and
Anne, wearing her scarlet stockings and new
shoes, and holding fast to the captain&#8217;s hand,
walked with him up the street to the house of
the man who had been at the wharf when the
sloop came in.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are good people, born in Wellfleet,&#8221;
said the captain to Anne, as they walked
along, &#8220;and I shall ask them to keep you
over night. I shall sleep in the sloop, and to-morrow
we will find out all we can about your
father.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Freemans, for that was the name of Captain
Enos&#8217;s friends, gave Anne a warm welcome
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
Their house seemed very large and grand to the
little girl. There was a carpet on the sitting-room
floor, the first Anne had ever seen, and
pictures on the walls, and a high mantel with
tall brass candlesticks.</p>
<p>The room in which she slept seemed very
wonderful to Anne. The bed was so high that
she had to step up from a footstool to get in it,
and then down, down she went in billows of
feathers. In the morning one of the Freeman
girls came in to waken her. She was a girl of
about fifteen, with pretty, light, curling hair and
blue eyes. She smiled pleasantly at Anne, and
told her that there was a basin of warm water
for her to bathe her face and hands in.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will brush out your hair for you, if you
wish,&#8221; she said kindly.</p>
<p>But Anne said she could brush her own hair.
Rose Freeman waited till Anne was quite ready
for breakfast and went down the broad flight of
stairs with her. Anne watched her new friend
admiringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;She looks just like her name, just like a
rose,&#8221; she said to herself, and resolved that she
would remember and walk just as Rose did, and
try and speak in the same pleasant way.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>Before breakfast was finished Captain Enos
came up from the wharves. He smiled as he
looked at Anne&#8217;s bright face and smooth hair,
and nodded approvingly. Then he and Mr.
Freeman began to talk about the soldiers, and
the best way to find John Nelson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Rose,&#8221; said Mr. Freeman; &#8220;the captain
and I will walk up near King&#8217;s Chapel and
see what we can find out, and you and the little
maid can come with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rose went up-stairs and came down wearing
a little brown jacket and a hat of brown silk
with a green feather on it. In her hands she
brought a blue cape and a blue hat with a broad
ribbon bow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother says you are to wear these,&#8221; she said
to Anne, with a little smile; &#8220;&#8217;Tis a cape and
hat that I wore when I was a little girl, and I
would like to have you wear them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never wore a hat before,&#8221; said Anne.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very becoming,&#8221; said Rose, and the
little party started out.</p>
<p>Mr. Freeman stopped here and there to ask
questions, and Anne, holding fast to Rose Freeman&#8217;s
hand, looked wonderingly at the houses
and the people. They went into a shop, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
Captain Enos bought a fine warm brown shawl
to take home to Mrs. Stoddard, and asked Rose
Freeman to help Anne select a pretty stuff for a
dress. The girls decided upon a small plaid of
dark blue and brown, and the stuff was carefully
wrapped up and Captain Enos took the
package.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have news at last,&#8221; said Mr. Freeman, who
had been talking with a man at the door of the
shop. &#8220;We will walk up to the Common and
see if we cannot get sight of your father. He
was here yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne listened eagerly, almost forgetting Rose
Freeman, whose hand she still held tightly, in
the thought that her dear father might be very
near and that she would soon see him.</p>
<p>They walked toward the Common, and Mr.
Freeman told the others to stand near the big
elm while he went to make inquiries. He was
gone but a few moments, when Rose Freeman
felt Anne&#8217;s hand slip from her own, and saw the
little girl running swiftly across the grass calling
out, &#8220;Father! Father!&#8221;</p>
<p>John Nelson heard the voice and stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anne, Anne!&#8221; he answered, and in a moment
the little girl in scarlet stockings and blue
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
cape and hat was gathered into the close clasp
of the dark, slender man.</p>
<p>Then how much there was to say! How
eagerly Anne told him all the pleasant news!
How warmly Captain Enos shook his hand, and
called him a brave fellow; and John Nelson
tried to thank the captain for all his kindness
to Anne.</p>
<p>Anne held fast to his hand as they walked
together to the wharf where the sloop lay.
Captain Enos said that he must start for home
the next morning, and there was a great deal
for them all to talk about. Rose Freeman and
her father left them at the wharf, after Captain
Enos had promised that he would bring Anne
to their house in time for supper.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a plan, John,&#8221; said Captain Enos;
&#8220;when we have settled with the British, and
that must be soon now, you must come to Province
Town and live with us. How would you
like that, Anne?&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne smiled happily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Best of anything!&#8221; she declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;I need help with my fishing,&#8221; went on Captain
Enos, &#8220;and there&#8217;s an empty loft next to
Anne&#8217;s room, where you can sleep. So think
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
of Anne&#8217;s home as yours, John. You&#8217;d not
break Mistress Stoddard&#8217;s heart by taking away
the child?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was good fortune led her to your door,&#8221;
said John Nelson gratefully. &#8220;I can see for
myself that she is content and happy. And I&#8217;ll
be a fortunate man to come into your house,
Enos Stoddard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How soon will you come, father?&#8221; asked
Anne, hopefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think &#8217;twill not be longer than another
spring before the British leave us in peace,&#8221; replied
her father. &#8220;But we need more soldiers
to let them know we are ready for war.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Enos nodded. &#8220;There&#8217;s a half dozen
good Province Town men ready to come, and as
many more from Truro, if a dozen would help,&#8221;
he found a chance to whisper.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll talk of this later,&#8221; said Anne&#8217;s father.
&#8220;I only hope you&#8217;ll get safe back to Province
Town harbor from this trip.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No fear,&#8221; laughed Captain Enos. &#8220;General
Gage is doing his best to starve Boston out.
Maybe we Province Town men can do the cause
of Liberty good service if we can bring in loads
of fish for the people.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to have British troops quartered
on us,&#8221; replied Nelson. &#8220;General Gage is taking
rough measures with everybody who opposes
him. Dr. Joseph Warren tried to stop the fortifications
on Boston Neck, but &#8217;twas no use. And
word is being sent to settlements to be ready to
furnish men. We&#8217;ve got supplies in Concord,
and Americans have been drilling for some
time. We&#8217;ll be ready for war if war comes.
I&#8217;ve a message for the Newburyport men to be
ready to join us, but I see no way of getting out
of Boston. You&#8217;re a brave man, Captain Stoddard,
to come into harbor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Enos&#8217;s face brightened as he listened
to John Nelson.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d find no trouble in slipping down the
coast to Newburyport,&#8221; he said eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; responded Nelson, &#8220;tho&#8217; there&#8217;s
no need for my telling you that there&#8217;s British
craft cruising all about, and a man caught with
a message to &#8216;rebels,&#8217; as they call us, stands no
chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d keep my message to myself,&#8221; answered
Captain Enos.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you could, a message by word of mouth;
but this is written, and has a drawing as well.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
I have it under the lining of my coat. But
there&#8217;s no way for me to get out of the town.
I&#8217;m well known by many of the English.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me take it.&#8221; Captain Stoddard&#8217;s voice
was eager. &#8220;&#8217;Tis ill-luck that we Province Town
men are to have no part in this affair. I&#8217;ll get
the paper safe to Newburyport. Tell me to
whom I am to give it.&#8221;</p>
<p>But John Nelson shook his head. &#8220;You&#8217;d
be caught, and maybe sent to England,&#8221; he
answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not be caught. And if they catch me
they&#8217;d not find the papers,&#8221; he promised, and
before they parted Nelson had agreed to deliver
the package that day. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give it to Anne,&#8221;
he promised. &#8220;It will not do for me to meet
you again. There are too many eyes about.
Let Anne walk along, with that tall girl yonder,
about sunset toward the South Meeting House,
and I&#8217;ll give it to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Stoddard nodded, and walked away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anne,&#8221; he said when they met in the Freemans&#8217;
sitting-room just before dinner, &#8220;you can
be of great help to your father and to me. But
you must be wise and silent. When you walk
with Rose this afternoon your father will meet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
you and hand you a flat package. Thrust it
inside your frock, and say nothing of it to Rose,
or to any one, and bring it safe to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed, Uncle Enos,&#8221; the little girl answered.
&#8220;Am I to ask Rose to walk with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, toward the South Meeting House,&#8221;
answered Captain Enos, &#8220;about an hour before
sunset.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I keep silent and bring the package safely,
will you forgive me for hiding in the boat?&#8221;
pleaded Anne.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I will, child, and take you for a
brave girl as well,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>Anne was joyful at the thought of another
word from her father, and Rose was quite ready
to go for another walk.</p>
<p>They had just turned into King Street when
John Nelson met them. Anne wore the pretty
cape Rose had given her and her father slipped
the packet into her hand without Rose seeing it.
She grasped it tightly, and held it under the
cape. &#8220;Be a good child, Anne, and do whatever
Captain Stoddard may bid thee,&#8221; her father said
as he bade her good-bye.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>A CANDY PARTY</h3>
</div>

<p>The next morning proved warm and pleasant
with only a light breeze, but Captain Enos had
his sloop ready at an early hour, and when
Anne, with Mr. Freeman and Rose, came down
to the wharf he was anxious to start at once.</p>
<p>Anne still wore the blue cape, which Mrs.
Freeman had insisted on giving her, and the hat
was in a round pasteboard box, which Anne
carried carefully, and which was put away in
the cabin with Aunt Martha&#8217;s new shawl and
the cloth for Anne&#8217;s new dress.</p>
<p>As the sloop sailed away from the wharf
Anne waved her hand to Rose Freeman until she
could no longer see her. Captain Enos watched
the little girl anxiously; he was half afraid that
Anne might be disappointed because she could
not stay with her father, but her face was bright
and smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the packet your father handed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
you?&#8221; Captain Enos questioned eagerly, as soon
as his sloop was clear of the wharf.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have it pinned safe inside my frock,&#8221; she
answered. &#8220;Shall I give it to you now, Uncle
Enos?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe &#8217;Tis safer with you, Anne,&#8221; replied
the captain. &#8220;It may be that some British
boat will overhaul us, and question us. I&#8217;m
doing an errand, Anne, for your father. If this
boat is taken and I am made a prisoner, you are
to say that you want to go to Newburyport.
That and no more. Mayhap they&#8217;ll set you
ashore there. Then make your way to Squire
Coffin&#8217;s house as best you may. Give him the
packet. Tell him the story, and he&#8217;ll find a way
to reach your father. Do you understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Uncle Enos,&#8221; said Anne very soberly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Repeat what I have told you, that I may
be sure,&#8221; said Captain Enos, and Anne obeyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I do not want to be set ashore in a
strange place,&#8221; she said soberly. &#8220;How should
I get back to Province Town?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will be taken care of, never fear,&#8221;
responded Captain Enos, &#8220;and you&#8217;ll be doing
a good service to the cause of liberty, Anne, if
you carry the papers safely. Your Aunt Martha
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
will indeed be proud of you. Remember what
I have told you. But I hope to slip in behind
Plum Island and make a landing without being
seen. The wind is favoring us. You have had
a fine visit, Anne?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed!&#8221; agreed the little girl, &#8220;and
I have a present for Aunt Martha,&#8221; she said, as
the sloop ran out among the islands. &#8220;See, my
father gave me this for her,&#8221; and she held up a
gold coin. &#8220;Will she not be pleased?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But she will be better pleased to have you
safe home again,&#8221; said Captain Enos. &#8220;What
do you think Amanda Cary will say when she
hears of your voyage to Boston and of all the
fine things you have seen there? &#8217;Tis not many
of the children in Province Town have ever
taken such a journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She will think it a better voyage than the
one we took to House Point Island,&#8221; answered
Anne. &#8220;I have something for Amanda, too.
Rose Freeman gave me a package of barley
sugar, and I said to myself I would take it home
to Amanda.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Enos kept a watchful eye for suspicious
looking craft. But his course lay well inshore,
and he was apparently not noticed by any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
of the vessels. Before noon he was cruising
along the Ipswich shore, and made his landing
at Newburyport without having been spoken.</p>
<p>&#8220;The worst part of the business is before us,&#8221;
he said to Anne, as he made the boat fast. &#8220;If I
leave the boat here, I may come back and find
no trace of her, but leave her I must, or Squire
Coffin will wait in vain for the papers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I can carry them,&#8221; said Anne. &#8220;Tell
me where to go, and I&#8217;ll come straight back and
say no word of my errand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis the best possible way. Did I not say
that you were a wise child!&#8221; declared Captain
Enos, his face beaming with delight. &#8220;Put on
your pretty hat and cape, and follow that lane
up to the main road. Then ask for Squire
Coffin&#8217;s house of the first person you meet.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a few moments Anne was ready to start.
As she walked up the lane Captain Enos&#8217;s eyes
followed her anxiously. &#8220;I can see no danger
in it for the child,&#8221; he said aloud, and then,
sailor fashion, set about putting his boat in order.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;twill be a cold night, but the cabin will be
snug and warm,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get out of
here before sunset and maybe make Province
Town by daybreak.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>Anne walked up the pleasant lane. Her feet
sank deep in the leaves from the overarching
trees, and made a cheerful, crackling sound.
She could see the roofs of houses not far
away, and as she turned from the lane into a
road she met two girls not much larger than
herself. They looked at her curiously, and
when Anne stopped they smiled in a friendly
way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you please to tell me where I can
find Squire Coffin?&#8221; Anne asked, feeling very
brave and a little important.</p>
<p>&#8220;Squire Coffin is my uncle,&#8221; the larger of
the two girls replied. &#8220;I&#8217;m going there now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have an errand,&#8221; Anne explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; responded both the little girls, but
Anne could see that they wondered who this
strange little girl could be, and what her errand
was.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may come with us if you want to,&#8221;
Squire Coffin&#8217;s niece said, and Anne was very
glad to walk with these silent little girls, for
neither of them spoke again until they stopped
in front of a tall, square white house very near
the street. As Anne looked up at it she thought
that she had never seen so many windows before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
in one house. &#8220;That&#8217;s Uncle Coffin on the
porch,&#8221; explained his niece.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Anne, and as the two
little girls politely curtseyed she endeavored to
imitate them, and with apparent success. Then
she went up the stone steps toward the dignified
looking gentleman who stood in the doorway.</p>
<p>She held the packet under her cape, and as
she came near him she whispered, as Captain
Enos had told her to do, &#8220;This is from Boston.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Great George!&#8221; he exclaimed grabbing the
package, in what seemed a very rude manner to
Anne, and putting it quickly in his pocket,
&#8220;and how came you by it?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Anne remembered her promise to keep
quiet, and she also remembered that the squire&#8217;s
niece had made the queer little curtsey on saying
good-bye. So Anne bobbed very prettily to
the squire, and said &#8220;good-bye,&#8221; and ran down
the steps, leaving the squire standing amazed.
It was many weeks before he learned the name
of the little maid, and that her home was in
Province Town.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></div>
<p>It was an easy matter to find her way back to
the lane. There was an orchard just at the
corner of the road, and a man was gathering
apples. &#8220;Want an apple?&#8221; he called.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; answered Anne, and now, being
rather proud of her new accomplishment, she
curtseyed very politely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, you are a young lady, miss.
Come up to the fence and I&#8217;ll hand you the
apples.&#8221; Anne obeyed, and the good-natured
man gave her two big red-cheeked apples. They
seemed very wonderful to the little girl from
the sandy shore village, where apples were not
often to be seen, and she thanked him delightedly.</p>
<p>Captain Enos was watching for her, and as
soon as she was on board he swung the sloop
clear of the wharf, ran up his mainsail and
headed toward the outer channel. As they
looked back at the little wharf they saw a tall
man come running down the lane.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon that&#8217;s the squire,&#8221; chuckled Captain
Enos.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is,&#8221; said Anne.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now for Province Town. I guess
we&#8217;ve helped a little bit, Anne. At least you
have.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>Anne was eating one of the big red apples,
and thinking about Squire Coffin&#8217;s big house
and small niece.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll tell Aunt Martha all that&#8217;s happened,&#8221;
went on Captain Enos, &#8220;but do not speak to any
one else of it, Anne. &#8217;Twould make trouble for
your father and for me if our trip to Newburyport
was known.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not speak of it,&#8221; Anne promised.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been a good trip,&#8221; said Captain Enos.
&#8220;Mr. Freeman paid me well for the fish. I have
a keg of molasses in the cabin, which will be
welcome news for Martha.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they came into harbor at sunrise next
morning and Captain Enos dropped anchor and
lowered the big mainsail, Anne looked eagerly
toward the shore. She could see Jimmie Starkweather
and his father watching them. After
Captain Enos had lowered the keg of molasses
into the dory, and put in the box that held
Anne&#8217;s hat, and the other packages, he helped
Anne over the side of the sloop to a seat in the
bow of the dory.</p>
<p>As soon as the boat touched the shore Jimmie
and his father ran down to help draw it up on
the beach. Jimmie looked at Captain Enos as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
if he half expected a scolding, but as soon
as Captain Enos landed he patted the boy&#8217;s
shoulder kindly, and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;The little maid has told me all about it.
You were not greatly to blame, Jimmie. And
the trip turned out all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw my father,&#8221; said Anne, and then ran
away toward home, leaving Captain Enos to tell
of the visit to Boston.</p>
<p>Aunt Martha had seen the sloop come to
anchor, and was waiting at the door to welcome
Anne.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Enos and I have a secret with my
father,&#8221; Anne whispered to Mrs. Stoddard, &#8220;and
we have been to Newburyport.&#8221; And then the
story of the wonderful trip was told, and Anne
showed Mrs. Stoddard how she had curtseyed to
the squire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! Well!&#8221; exclaimed the good woman
in amazement. &#8220;It does seem as if you had all
sorts of adventures, Anne. To think of Enos
undertaking such a thing. I&#8217;m proud of you
both. &#8217;twill be a fine story to tell your grandchildren,
Anne. How you carried news from
Boston patriots to Newburyport. But do not
speak of it till we are through with all these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
troublous days.&#8221; And again Anne promised to
keep silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;To think you should run off like that,
child,&#8221; continued Aunt Martha. &#8220;When Jimmie
Starkweather came up and told me you were
gone I could scarce believe him till I had
climbed the stairs to the loft and found no trace
of you. But I am right glad you wore your
shoes and stockings. Where did the blue cape
come from?&#8221;</p>
<p>By this time they were in the kitchen, and
Anne had put down the box that held her hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Freeman gave it to me,&#8221; she replied,
&#8220;and see! I have a new hat!&#8221; and she opened
the box and took out the pretty hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought thy uncle would take thee straight
to Mistress Freeman,&#8221; said Mrs. Stoddard.</p>
<p>&#8220;And we found my father,&#8221; went on Anne
happily, &#8220;and he sent thee this,&#8221; and she drew
the gold piece from her pocket and gave it to
Mrs. Stoddard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; said Aunt Martha, &#8220;&#8217;Tis a fine
piece of money, and your father is kind to send
it. I will use it well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Uncle Enos has fetched you a fine
shawl and a keg of molasses,&#8221; said Anne.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
&#8220;You do not think there was great harm in my
hiding in the sloop, Aunt Martha?&#8221; The little
girl&#8217;s face was so troubled that Aunt Martha gave
her another kiss, and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;It has turned out well, but thee must never
do so again. Suppose a great storm had come
up and swept the sloop from her moorings that
night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rose Freeman looks just like a rose,&#8221; said
Anne, feeling quite sure that Aunt Martha was
not displeased; &#8220;and she walks so softly that you
can hardly hear her, and she speaks softly, too.
I am going to walk and speak just as she
does.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is right,&#8221; agreed Mrs. Stoddard. &#8220;I
am sure that she is a well-spoken girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Captain Enos came up the hill toward
home Anne had already put her blue cape and
hat carefully away, and was sitting near the fire
with the white kitten curled up in her lap.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Freemans do not eat in their kitchen,&#8221;
said Anne, as they sat down to supper; &#8220;they
eat in a square room with a shining floor, and
where there is a high mantel-shelf with china
images.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a fine house,&#8221; agreed Captain Enos,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
&#8220;well built of brick. &#8217;twas a great thing for
Anne to see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis not so pleasant a house as this,&#8221; said
Anne. &#8220;I could not see the harbor from any
window, and the shore is not smooth and sandy
like the shores of our harbor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Enos smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Anne,&#8221; he said; &#8220;Boston
houses may do for town people, but we sailor-folk
like our own best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed!&#8221; replied Anne, &#8220;and I do not
believe a beach-plum grows on their shore.
And nothing I tasted there was so good as Aunt
Martha&#8217;s meal bread.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next morning Anne started for school,
wearing the new shoes and scarlet stockings and
the little plaid shawl. The children were all
anxious to hear about what she saw in Boston,
and she told them of the soldiers on the Common,
and of the shops, and of the houses made
of brick and stone, and she showed Amanda
how to make the wonderful curtsey. But Elder
Haven soon called them to take their seats, and
it was not until the noon recess that she found
a chance to speak alone with Amanda.</p>
<p>The two little girls sat down on the front
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
door-step of Elder Haven&#8217;s house, and Anne told
of the wonderful sail to Boston, and had just
begun to describe Rose Freeman when the
teacher&#8217;s voice was heard calling them in.</p>
<p>As soon as school closed for the day, Amanda
said that she could walk home with Anne and
see the new cape and hat, and hear more about
Rose Freeman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like better to live in Boston
than here?&#8221; asked Amanda, as they walked
along.</p>
<p>Anne looked at her in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Amanda!&#8221; she said; &#8220;of course I
wouldn&#8217;t. It is not seemly there to go out-of-doors
without a hat; and Rose Freeman said
that she had never been barefooted in her life.
She has fine white stockings knit of cotton yarn
for summer, and low shiny shoes that she called
&#8216;slippers.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twould be hard to wear shoes all the year,&#8221;
agreed Amanda, looking down at her own stout
leather shoes, &#8220;but I like them well now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I brought you a present from Boston,&#8221; said
Anne just as they reached the Stoddards&#8217; door.
&#8220;Rose Freeman gave it to me, and I saved it
for you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Amanda,&#8221; said Mrs. Stoddard, as the
two girls came into the kitchen, &#8220;are you not
glad to have Anne safe home again? &#8217;twas
quite a journey to take.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She likes Province Town better than Boston,&#8221;
answered Amanda smilingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure she does, and why not?&#8221; replied
Mrs. Stoddard. &#8220;There are few places where
there is so much salt water to be seen as here,
and no better place for fishing. Now, Anne, I
have a little surprise for you. I have asked Mr.
and Mrs. Starkweather and their six boys to
come up this evening, and your father and
mother, Amanda, and you and Amos. The
evenings are getting fine and long now and we
must begin to be neighborly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I mustn&#8217;t stay long now,&#8221; said
Amanda; &#8220;it will be pleasant to come up here
again in the evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amanda tried on Anne&#8217;s blue cape and hat,
looked admiringly at Mrs. Stoddard&#8217;s shining
gold piece and brown shawl, and then Anne
handed her the package of barley sugar.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will keep it,&#8221; said Amanda, gratefully;
&#8220;&#8217;twould seem ungrateful to eat a present.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Stoddard nodded. &#8220;Keep it until Sunday,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
Amanda,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but then it will be
well to eat a part of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But can she not taste it now?&#8221; asked Anne.
&#8220;I am sure it is good. It came out of a big glass
jar in a shop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see I must tell you two little girls a secret,&#8221;
said Mrs. Stoddard, &#8220;but Amanda must not tell
Amos.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; said Amanda quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is about this evening,&#8221; said Mrs. Stoddard;
&#8220;I am going to make a fine dish of molasses
candy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Aunt Martha!&#8221; &#8220;Oh, Mistress Stoddard!&#8221;
exclaimed the little girls together.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been years since I tasted any myself,&#8221;
went on Mrs. Stoddard, &#8220;but I remember well
how it is made; and I do not believe one of
you children has ever tasted it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother has told us about it,&#8221; said
Amanda, &#8220;and said that when times were better
she would make us some.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We all need cheering up,&#8221; said Mrs. Stoddard,
&#8220;and I am glad I can give you children a treat
to remember. Now, Amanda, you see why it
will be best not to eat your barley sugar until
Sunday.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I have good times every day since I gave
you the white kitten,&#8221; said Amanda, as she bade
Anne good-bye, and started for home.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must bring all our chairs into the kitchen
to-night, Anne,&#8221; said Aunt Martha, as soon as
supper was finished, &#8220;for even then I doubt if
there be seats enough for our company.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had best bring in my long bench from
the shed,&#8221; said Captain Enos; &#8220;&#8217;twill be just
the thing to put a row of Starkweather boys
on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The youngest is but two years old,&#8221; said Mrs.
Stoddard; &#8220;&#8217;Tis like he will find our bed a good
resting place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Cary with Amos and Amanda
were the first to arrive, and as they came in
Captain Enos put two big pieces of pitch pine
on the fire. In a moment it blazed up making
the kitchen as light as day.</p>
<p>The Starkweathers, climbing up the sandy
hill, saw the bright light shining through the
windows of the little house, and Mrs. Starkweather
exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Does it not look cheerful? To think of us
all coming to a merrymaking! It was surely a
kind thought of Mistress Stoddard&#8217;s.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we play games?&#8221; asked Daniel, the
boy next younger than Jimmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be,&#8221; answered his mother, &#8220;and you
boys must be quiet and not rough in your play.
Remember there is a little girl in the house.&#8221;</p>
<p>The youngest Starkweather boy, carried carefully
by his father, was sound asleep when they
reached the Stoddards&#8217;, and was put comfortably
down on Mrs. Stoddard&#8217;s big bed, while the others
gathered around the fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit you here, boys,&#8221; directed Captain Enos,
pointing to the long bench, &#8220;and you girls can
bring your stools beside me. I have a fine game
for you to play. Do you see this shining brass
button? &#8217;twas given me in Boston, and came
from the coat of a British soldier. Now we will
play &#8216;Button&#8217; with it,&#8221; and the captain, with a
few whispered words to Jimmie Starkweather,
slid the shining button into his hand, and
&#8220;Button, button! who&#8217;s got the button?&#8221; was
soon being laughingly asked from one to another
as the brass button went from Jimmie to Amos,
passed into Anne&#8217;s hand and swiftly on to
Amanda, and back to Jimmie before Captain
Enos could locate it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; exclaimed one of the younger Starkweather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
boys. &#8220;Mistress Stoddard is pouring
syrup into a kettle!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, my boy,&#8221; said Captain Enos laughingly,
&#8220;and now you will all be glad that I had a good
trip to Boston, for I brought home a keg of fine
molasses, and now you will have some first-class
candy!&#8221;</p>
<p>There were many exclamations of surprise and
pleasure, even the older members of the party
declaring that it would indeed be a fine treat;
and Mrs. Starkweather said that it reminded her
of the times when she was a little girl like Anne,
and her mother made candy for her.</p>
<p>The molasses boiled and bubbled in the big
kettle hung over the fire, and Mrs. Stoddard and
Mrs. Cary took turns in stirring it. The children
brought dippers of cold water for spoonfuls
of the hot molasses to be dropped in to see if it
had begun to candy; and when Amanda lifted a
stringy bit from her tin cup and held it up for
Mrs. Stoddard to see, it was decided that it was
cooked enough, and the kettle was lifted from the
fire and the steaming, fragrant mass turned into
carefully buttered pans.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must set these out-of-doors to cool,&#8221; said
Mrs. Stoddard; so Jimmie, Amos and Daniel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
were each entrusted with a pan to carry out on
the broad step.</p>
<p>&#8220;When it is cool we will all work it,&#8221; said Mrs.
Stoddard; &#8220;that means pull and twist it into
sticks.&#8221;</p>
<p>It did not take long for the candy to cool, and
then under Mrs. Stoddard&#8217;s directions each child
was given a piece to work into shape. But the
candy proved too tempting to work over, and in
a few minutes the long bench was filled with a
row of boys, each one happily chewing away
upon a clumsy piece of molasses candy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>A SPRING PICNIC</h3>
</div>

<p>Before the six weeks of school came to an
end Anne could read, and could write well
enough to begin a letter to her father, although
there seemed no chance of sending it. She
thought often of her visit to Newburyport, and
wondered if she would ever see Squire Coffin&#8217;s
little niece again. And she remembered William
Trull, and his little daughters of whom he
had told her. But no news had come to Province
Town of how Boston was faring.</p>
<p>A few weeks after Captain Enos&#8217;s trip to Boston
another Province Town fisherman had
started out with a cargo of fish, hoping for
equal good fortune. But weeks passed and he
did not return, and no tidings were heard of
him, and his family and neighbors now feared
that the British had captured his boat and taken
him prisoner.</p>
<p>No word came to Anne from her father, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
as the ice formed along the shore and over the
brooks, the cold winds came sweeping in from
sea with now and then a fall of snow that whitened
the marshes and the woods, the little settlement
on the end of Cape Cod was entirely
shut off from news from Boston, and they knew
not what the British were doing.</p>
<p>Captain Enos and the men of the port went
fishing in the harbor, and the women and children
kept snug at home in the little houses.</p>
<p>Captain Enos had finished the cedar chair for
Anne&#8217;s doll, and Amos had made one as near
like it as possible for Amanda&#8217;s &#8220;Lovely Anne.&#8221;
Both the little girls could now knit nearly as
smoothly as Mrs. Stoddard herself, and almost
every day Amanda came up to Mrs. Stoddard&#8217;s,
for she and Anne were reading &#8220;Pilgrim&#8217;s
Progress&#8221; together. Now and then Mrs. Stoddard
would read several pages aloud of the adventures
of Christian, while the two little girls
knit. Anne had a warm hood of gray and scarlet
yarn which she had knit herself, and mittens
to match, so that she could go to church on
Sundays, and run down to Mrs. Starkweather&#8217;s
or to see Amanda without being chilled by the
cold.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>It was a mild day late in February when Jimmie
Starkweather brought home a pink blossom
from the woods.</p>
<p>&#8220;See, mother! The first Mayflower,&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;I found it half under the snow. Does
it not smell sweet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It does indeed, son,&#8221; replied Mrs. Starkweather;
&#8220;bring me your grandmother&#8217;s pink
china cup from the cupboard, fill it with cool
water, and we will put the blossom on the table
for thy father to see. Spring is indeed close at
hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the same day that Jimmie found the
arbutus bloom, Captain Enos came in from fishing
with news to tell. A Boston schooner outward
bound had come near to where he was
fishing, and in response to his hail and call of
&#8220;What news?&#8221; had answered that a battle was
now expected at any day between the British
and Americans.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it be so,&#8221; said Captain Enos, &#8220;&#8217;twill not
be long before the British ships will be homeward
bound, and they&#8217;ll not stop to trouble us
much on their way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must keep a lookout for them,&#8221; said
Captain Starkweather. &#8220;I wish we could get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
more news. &#8217;Tis like enough all will be settled
before we know aught of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>All through March, with its high winds and
heavy rains the people watched the harbor for a
sight of the big white-winged ships, knowing
that if the English ships were homeward bound
it would mean that the Americans had won,
and that the colonies would be free from paying
the heavy taxes which England had fixed
upon them, and that they could go about their
work in peace and quiet.</p>
<p>April brought warm, sunny days, and Anne
no longer wore the knit hood and mittens, and
had once more set her playhouse under the pine
trees in order, and now Amanda with her doll
often came to play with her.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis nearly a year ago since my father was
captured by the British,&#8221; said Anne one day as
she and Amanda, followed by the white kitten,
went out under the pine trees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anne!&#8221; exclaimed Amanda, &#8220;I did not
know what &#8216;spy&#8217; and &#8216;traitor&#8217; meant when I
called those words at you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne looked at her playmate smilingly.
&#8220;You would not say them now, Amanda, would
you?&#8221; she answered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Say them now!&#8221; repeated Amanda. &#8220;Why,
Anne, you are my best friend, and your father
a soldier. &#8217;twas but yesterday my father said
that there was but one thing that Province
Town had to be proud of in this war, and that
was John Nelson, your father, because he is the
only soldier from the settlement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne&#8217;s cheeks flushed happily. &#8220;&#8217;twas hard
not to have my father,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but he may
come back any day now; Uncle Enos says so.
And he is to live with us, and help Uncle Enos
with the fishing. And then, Amanda, I shall
be the happiest little girl in the settlement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow my mother is going to the
marshes to gather young pine tips, and arrowroot,
and young spruce tips and the roots of
thoroughwort to brew beer with,&#8221; said Amanda;
&#8220;Amos and I are to go with her, and if your
Aunt Martha be willing you can go with us.
She plans to take something to eat and be away
till past noon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure I may go,&#8221; replied Anne eagerly,
&#8220;and we can bring home Mayflowers. There
are many all along near the pine trees.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Amanda, &#8220;and will it not be fine
to eat our dinner out-of-doors? Amos plans to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
start a fire and cook a fish for us, over it, this
time, not under sand as he did when we were
on the island.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Stoddard gave her consent for Anne to
go next day with the Carys. &#8220;I will bake you
a molasses cake to carry,&#8221; she said; &#8220;if it were
a few weeks later you could call it a May party.
In England, and I know it is now a custom in
many of our towns, all the children gather
and put flowers on their heads, and have a May-pole
wreathed with flowers, and dance around
it. And they choose a little girl for Queen of
the May.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can we not do that, Aunt Martha, when
May is really here?&#8221; asked Anne.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; replied Aunt Martha, &#8220;if the minister
sees no objection, and if we get good news
before that time, why, a May-day party would
be a pretty thing. The boys could put up the
May-pole near the spring, and there will be all
sorts of wild things in blossom by that time.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they started off for the marshes Anne
told Amanda what her Aunt Martha had said,
and Mrs. Cary and Amos were greatly interested.
Amos said that he knew where he could
get a fine pole, and Mrs. Cary said that the little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
girls could gather flowers and fasten them to the
pole with vines and strings before it was set up.</p>
<p>&#8220;And there must be a big wreath fastened on
top of the pole,&#8221; said Mrs. Cary, &#8220;and by rights
there should be long bright streamers coming
down from the top for each to hold and twist in
and out as they dance around it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can we not take long strings and fasten
flowers about them?&#8221; asked Anne.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, indeed!&#8221; replied Mrs. Cary.
&#8220;&#8217;twill be better than any bright ribbons. Now
we must surely have a May-day party. Near the
spring will be the very place.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they searched for thoroughwort, and picked
the tender spruce and pine tips, they all talked
of the coming May-day, but Amos soon began
to look about for a good place to make his fire.
He had brought the fish in a covered basket,
and said that he knew he could cook it as well
as if he had a kettle to boil it in. He made a
fire at a little distance from the woods, and then
busied himself in putting up two crotched sticks,
one on each side of the fire; a third stick rested
across these two, and from it hung the fish,
directly over the blaze.</p>
<p>Amos watched his fire very carefully, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
kept a brisk blaze until the fish began to grow
brown and steam. Then he declared that it was
nearly cooked, and so let his fire die down until
only a bed of smouldering coals remained.</p>
<p>They all thought the fish tasted as good as if
it had been cooked in a pan or kettle, and Mrs.
Cary had a fine cake of Indian meal, and with
Anne&#8217;s molasses cake they all said that it was
the best dinner any one could have. The April
sky was soft and blue, the sun warm, and Amos
was sure that in a few days he could go in
swimming.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s only the nineteenth of April,&#8221; said
Anne.</p>
<p>Afterward these children always remembered
the nineteenth of April, and would say, &#8220;That
was the day we had our picnic at the marshes,&#8221;
and on that day the minutemen were gathered
at Lexington and Earl Percy was urging his
tired men to meet them, and the great battle
which did so much to settle the fate of the
Americans was fought.</p>
<p>But the people at Province Town did not
know of this until long afterward. If Anne
had known on the day when she was so happy,
thinking of the May-day to come, and watching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
Amos cook the fish over the fire, that her
dear father with other brave men was at Cambridge
on guard waiting for the British, who
were determined to make a stand in their flight
from the minutemen, and that on that very day
her good friends, the Freemans, were hurrying
away toward Watertown to escape the dangers
of war which now centered about Boston, she
would not have cared so much about the May-day
plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be well to ask all the grown people
as well as the children to the May party,&#8221; said
Mrs. Cary, as the little party made its way
toward home that afternoon. &#8220;I do not think
there has ever been a May-day party before in
the town, and it will be good for all of us to try
and be cheerful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne and Amanda looked at her wonderingly.
The world seemed a very cheerful and happy
place to both the little girls, and they could not
know how anxious the older people were that
the trouble with England might soon come to
an end.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>THE MAY PARTY</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;A May-day party, eh?&#8221; said Elder Haven,
when Anne and Amanda told him of the plan.
&#8220;Why, I think it an excellent idea. It will
surely be a pleasant sight to see the children
dance about the May-pole, and I shall like well
to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>After Elder Haven had approved the parents
could find nothing wrong in the idea, and all
the children went Maying for arbutus and trailing
evergreens to wind about the pole.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of May-day Amos and
Jimmie were at the spring with a long smooth
pole. The other children soon followed them,
and Mrs. Starkweather came to show them how
to fasten the wreath at the top and the long
strings covered with vines and blossoms which
Anne and Amanda, with the help of Mrs. Stoddard
and the Starkweather boys, had made
ready the day before.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We used often to dance about a May-pole
when I was a girl in Barnstable,&#8221; said Mrs.
Starkweather. &#8220;To be sure it is an old English
custom, and just now England does not seem
our friend, but &#8217;Tis a pleasant custom that we do
well to follow. I know a little song that we all
used to sing as we took hold of the bright
streamers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that song,&#8221; said Dannie; &#8220;you call
it &#8216;May Song.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; said Mrs. Starkweather, &#8220;I&#8217;m
sure all my boys know it. I&#8217;ve sung them all
to sleep by it; and &#8217;Tis one I sing about my
work, for &#8217;Tis a cheerful and a merry lilt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It goes this way,&#8221; said Dannie, and began
to sing:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 6em;'>&#8220;Birds in the tree;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 6em;'>Humming of bees,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Wind singing over the sea;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 6em;'>Happy May-days,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 6em;'>Now do we praise,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>As we dance gladly round the May tree.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>As Dannie sang his mother and brothers
joined in with him, and the other children
listened in delight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you not sing it when we do &#8216;dance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
round the May tree,&#8217; Aunt Starkweather?&#8221;
asked Anne; &#8220;and if Dannie will sing it over
to us a few times I am sure that we can all sing
it, and then Elder Haven can hear us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dannie liked to sing, and he sang the little
verse over and over again until all the children
knew it, and until his mother said that they
must all run home and make themselves tidy,
and then come back, as the dance around the
May-pole was to be at two o&#8217;clock.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do wish that Uncle Enos could see it,&#8221;
said Anne, as she put on her new white pinafore
over her plaid dress, and fastened the coral beads
around her neck; &#8220;I know well he would like
to hear the song.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The boats went out early and may get in in
good time,&#8221; said Aunt Martha.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Starkweather says that there is always
a Queen of the May&mdash;a little girl whom the
other children choose to wear a wreath on her
head, and whatever the Queen tells them to do
they must do all May-day,&#8221; said Anne, as she
and Mrs. Stoddard walked toward the spring,
&#8220;but I do think the other children have forgotten
all about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes the children want to choose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
one to obey, I wonder,&#8221; said Mrs. Stoddard,
smiling down at Anne.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be because &#8217;Tis a little girl whom
they all like, and who is always kind and
pleasant to the other children,&#8221; said Anne. &#8220;If
&#8217;twas a King of the May we would all want
Jimmie Starkweather; but there are not so
many girls as boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other children were all at the spring with
bunches and wreaths of flowers, and Anne was
surprised to see that a mound of sand had been
heaped up and covered with pine boughs.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is that for?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a throne for the Queen,&#8221; said Dannie
Starkweather.</p>
<p>Mrs. Cary and Mrs. Starkweather were talking
with the children, and as Anne came near they
formed into a little circle round her, joining
hands and singing:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;Our May-queen,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Queen of the May,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>We&#8217;re ready to serve you</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>All this bright day.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Then Willie Starkweather, who was only four
years old, took Anne&#8217;s hand and led her to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
&#8220;throne&#8221; and said, &#8220;You mutht thit down,
Anne,&#8221; for Willie lisped, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll put the
crown on.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Anne sat down on the pine-covered sand-heap,
and Willie put a wreath of fragrant arbutus
on her head.</p>
<p>Captain Enos, hurrying up from the shore,
thought it the prettiest sight he had ever seen.
The tall pole, covered with green vines and
bright blossoms, the children forming in a circle
round Anne, and the pleasant May skies over
all, seemed to the sailor to make a picture worth
remembering.</p>
<p>Then came the dance round the May-pole and
the song. By this time, the other men had
come up from the shore; Elder Haven was there,
and every one in the little settlement had gathered
at the spring. It was a circle of happy
faces, and when the time came for them all to
start for their homes, each one said that Province
Town had never seen so pretty a sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis something we shall like to think about,&#8221;
said Elder Haven to Jimmie Starkweather, as
the two walked toward the Elder&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>Anne was sure that it was the happiest day
in her life. &#8220;I wish my father could have seen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
me, Aunt Martha,&#8221; she said, as they walked
toward home. &#8220;&#8217;Twould please him well to
know the children like me. &#8217;Tis only a year
since they did scorn me at the spring.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must forget about that, Anne,&#8221; said
Aunt Martha. &#8220;They chose you for Queen because
you have been a pleasant child. You see,
it matters not what they said before they knew
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Martha!&#8221; exclaimed Anne, suddenly
looking up toward the harbor, &#8220;see! There are
two big ships coming down the bay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not to be in peace long,&#8221; said Mrs.
Stoddard. &#8220;They are coming straight to anchorage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every one soon knew that the &#8220;Somerset&#8221; was
back again, and now the English sailors took
no trouble to be civil. They laid hands on provisions
of all sorts, but nevertheless they brought
good news.</p>
<p>William Trull found a chance to tell Captain
Enos that the Americans had won the battle at
Lexington. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be in harbor here but a day
or two,&#8221; he added; &#8220;we must be back to watch
the Americans at Charlestown.&#8221; And, sure
enough, the next morning the big ships had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
sailed away again, taking with them many
things that the little settlement could ill spare.</p>
<p>As the summer days lengthened, Anne longed
more and more for some news of her father.
The battle of Bunker Hill had brought another
triumph to the Americans, but the English vessels
still cruised about the coast, making the
fishermen careful about going far from shore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Enos, could we not go to Boston again
and find my father?&#8221; Anne would ask, and
Captain Enos would grow serious and shake his
head, and say it would be too great a risk to undertake.
So Anne helped Aunt Martha with
the work of the house, played with her doll under
the pine trees, and wandered about the shore
with Amanda, but always thinking of her absent
father, and wishing that she might go and
find him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am past nine years old. If I was a boy, I
could sail a boat to Boston,&#8221; she said to Amanda
one day, as they went down to the beach to
watch the fishing-boats come in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Amanda; &#8220;I guess that Amos
could sail a boat to Boston before he was nine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he could sail one there now,&#8221; exclaimed
Anne. &#8220;Oh, Amanda, wouldn&#8217;t Amos
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
sail us to Boston to find my father? Uncle
Enos will not; he says &#8217;Tis not safe. But surely
the English would not hurt two little girls and
a boy. Would Amos be afraid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid of what?&#8221; Amos had come up beside
them, and the sound of his voice made
them jump.</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid to sail a boat to Boston,&#8221; explained
Anne.</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be easy enough,&#8221; declared the
boy, &#8220;and I would like well to get the chance
to sail father&#8217;s &#8216;Peggy&#8217; to Boston.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you, Amos? And take Amanda and
me with you to find my father? I will take all
the blame, indeed I will. And if we find him
and bring him back, they will all think you a
brave boy, Amos.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They will not let us start,&#8221; said Amos.
&#8220;We&#8217;d have to put off in the night. But I&#8217;ll
do it. You girls must bring along something
to eat, and we&#8217;ll start at midnight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When?&#8221; asked Anne.</p>
<p>&#8220;To-night,&#8221; answered the boy. &#8220;Why, &#8217;twill
be a greater adventure than any boy of this settlement
ever had. If we make Boston, I may
be made prisoner by the British,&#8221; and Amos
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
looked as happy over the prospect as Anne did
at the thought of finding her father.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mistress Stoddard will not be pleased,&#8221; cautioned
Amanda.</p>
<p>&#8220;She did not greatly blame me before,&#8221; said
Anne. &#8220;She knows I want much to see my
father, and Uncle Enos does not want to go. If
we sail safely there and home, it will save Uncle
Enos trouble. He will not have to go himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Should we see Rose Freeman?&#8221; asked
Amanda.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be,&#8221; said Anne.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like well to go, if we could see her,&#8221;
Amanda said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Amos was now full of plans for the trip.
There would be a favoring tide at midnight, and
he was sure they could sail out of the harbor and
be well on their way by morning; and, giving
the girls many cautions about being on the shore
at the right time, he went happily off to look
over the sloop &#8220;Peggy,&#8221; and to wonder what
Jimmie Starkweather would say if he knew that
he, Amos, was going to sail a boat straight up to
Boston!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>THE SLOOP, &#8220;PEGGY&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>The sloop, &#8220;Peggy,&#8221; was becalmed. Anne,
Amanda and Amos looked over the smooth
stretch of water, but there was not a ripple to
be seen. Since sunrise, the boat had not moved.
They had made the start at midnight, as they
had planned, and had sailed away under a fair
wind; but before the sun rose the wind had
died away, and the mainsail now swung back
and forth and the boat drifted slowly with the
current.</p>
<p>None of the children had thought of bringing
a jug of fresh water, and the salt fish and corn
bread which they had brought along for food
made them very thirsty.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re off Barnstable now,&#8221; said Amos.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve a mind to let the boat drift in nearer
shore and anchor, and then row ashore in the
tender and get some water.&#8221;</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

THE BOAT BEGAN TO TIP<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></div>
<p>&#8220;How far is Barnstable from Boston?&#8221; asked
Anne.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miles and miles,&#8221; answered Amos. &#8220;&#8217;Tis
only about half-way up the cape from Province
Town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we could not walk to Boston from
there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Amos; &#8220;why should we walk?
There&#8217;ll be a good breeze come sunset. All we
need is a good drink of water, and there&#8217;s a
water-jug in the cabin. I can take it ashore
and fill it at some spring.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the children talked, the current had carried
the boat steadily toward shore, but now it
did not move.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s stuck on a sand-bar,&#8221; exclaimed Amos,
&#8220;and the tide&#8217;s turning. Perhaps I can walk
ashore.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not long before the boat began to tip
to one side, and as the tide went out, they found
themselves on a sand-bar, a full half mile from
shore. The water seemed to flow in little channels,
like wide brooks, here and there, between
the boat and the land, and Amos wondered if he
could either jump or wade those channels. The
hot July sun beat down upon them, they were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
very thirsty and uncomfortable, and Amanda
began to wish herself at home.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought not to have started,&#8221; she said,
ready to cry. &#8220;I know my mother won&#8217;t like
it, and Mistress Stoddard will not like it,
either.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne was very quiet. She was thirsty, hot
and uncomfortable, and being run aground on a
sand-bar near a strange shore was a very different
thing from her other prosperous voyage with
Captain Enos. What if they should never reach
Boston at all?</p>
<p>&#8220;They will all think that we have run away
this time,&#8221; said Amos, who had stepped over the
side of the boat onto the sand-bar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, they won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Anne. &#8220;I wrote
on a smooth chip, &#8216;Amanda and Amos and I
have gone to Boston to find my father,&#8217; and put
it on the kitchen table.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I could get across those channels
some way,&#8221; declared Amos, &#8220;and I am so thirsty
that I&#8217;m going to try it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amanda brought him the small stone jug
from the cabin, and telling the girls not even
to step out of the boat until he came back, Amos
started for the shore. They saw him wade the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
first channel, run across a long stretch of wet
sand, cross the other channel and reach the
shore safely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goody!&#8221; exclaimed Amanda; &#8220;now he will
find a spring, fill the jug and hurry back, and
we can have a good drink of water,&#8221; and she
turned smilingly to Anne. But Anne was looking
very sober. She had been thinking over
her other trip, and now remembered what Mrs.
Stoddard had said when she returned from
Boston.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Amanda!&#8221; she said, looking ready to
cry, &#8220;when I ran off before with Uncle Enos,
Aunt Martha did tell me that I must never do
so again. Now I have disobeyed her, and perhaps
she will not want me to live with her any
more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you can live with your father,&#8221; answered
Amanda cheerfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;But my father was to live with us,&#8221; said
Anne. &#8220;He was to have the big, pleasant loft
that looks toward the water, and was to help
Uncle Enos with the fishing. Perhaps they will
not want either of us since I have been so unruly
and disobedient.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amanda longed to tell Anne that she should
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
have a home with her, but she remembered that
the white kitten had to be given away because
they could not afford to keep it, and so kept
silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope Amos will not linger,&#8221; she said, after
a little silence. &#8220;He forgets that we are as
thirsty as he is.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little girls watched the shore anxiously,
expecting every minute to see Amos hurrying
back with a jug full of fresh water, but time
passed and he did not come.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the tide has turned,&#8221; said Amanda.
&#8220;See, the channels are widening every minute.
If Amos does not come soon the water will be
too deep. Oh, dear! I am afraid something
has befallen him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What could befall him?&#8221; questioned Anne.
&#8220;&#8217;Tis a smooth and pleasant shore, with much
taller trees than grow about Province Town.
He is just playing about and has forgotten us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anne was nearly right, for after Amos had
found a fine boiling spring and had drunk all
he wanted and then filled his jug, he had sat
down to rest under a wide-spreading oak tree.
The day was hot, he was very tired and sleepy,
having been awake all the night before, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
without forgetting the &#8220;Peggy&#8221; or her crew, he
dropped gently off to sleep. The tide came in,
lifted the &#8220;Peggy&#8221; from the sand-bar and a
gentle breeze carried her steadily out from shore,
and Amos slept on, knowing nothing of what
had happened. The sun was very low in the
western sky when he awoke. He sat up, rubbed
his eyes, snatched up the jug and ran to the
shore, but there was no boat to be seen.</p>
<p>Amos was now thoroughly frightened. He
ran up and down the quiet shore, calling the
name of his boat and shouting, &#8220;Amanda!&#8221;
&#8220;Anne!&#8221; at the top of his voice. The shadows
of the summer night deepened, a little
haze rose over the water, and Amos, crouching
down near the water&#8217;s edge, waited for night to
come.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know I shall never sleep any more,&#8221; he
whispered to himself, hardly daring to think of
what might happen to the little girls. He wished
that he had lowered the mainsail before coming
ashore.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ought to have dropped anchor, anyway,&#8221;
he said aloud, and almost forgot to be hungry in
his anxiety.</p>
<p>The shadows grew deeper, night settled down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
on land and sea and Amos went fast asleep again,
with his bare feet almost within reach of the
waves that rolled so softly up over the smooth
sand.</p>
<p>Anne and Amanda watched the tide come in
about the &#8220;Peggy,&#8221; and soon felt the boat move
under them. Then the mainsail filled and swung
out, as the breeze came up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Try and steer ashore, Amanda,&#8221; exclaimed
Anne.</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare not touch the rudder,&#8221; said Amanda.
&#8220;Whenever I have been in a boat, my father has
told me to sit still; and I do think it is the best
thing we can do now, Anne.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mayhap the wind will take us home again,&#8221;
said Anne, &#8220;and then your father will come
back and find Amos.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More like &#8217;twill take us straight out to sea,&#8221;
said Amanda.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis all my fault,&#8221; said Anne; &#8220;I did prevail
on you and Amos to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We both liked well to come,&#8221; answered
Amanda stoutly. &#8220;Amos should have known
better, for he is older. But he likes a risk over
well, and now he can play shipwrecked to his
heart&#8217;s desire.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My eyes are heavy with sleep,&#8221; said Anne.
&#8220;Let us say the small prayer that Elder Haven
taught us and sleep a little. &#8217;Tis dark and foggy;
we can see nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amanda reached out her sunburned little
hand and clasped Anne&#8217;s, and they repeated
aloud the prayer, asking for help and protection,
which Elder Haven had taught them; then,
curling themselves up in the bottom of the boat,
they went fast asleep.</p>
<p>But the &#8220;Peggy&#8221; did not sail far. The wind
died away, and the boat drifted with the tide.
When the little girls awoke it was bright sunshine,
and a big ship was coming slowly down
upon them.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a Britisher!&#8221; Amanda exclaimed; &#8220;like
as not she&#8217;s bound for England and will carry
us straight off,&#8221; and Amanda began crying
bitterly.</p>
<p>Before Anne could answer there came a hail
from the ship, and Anne and Amanda called
back, &#8220;Sloop &#8216;Peggy&#8217;! Sloop &#8216;Peggy&#8217;!&#8221; as
loudly as they could, as they had heard Province
Town captains do in answer to hails from
harbor boats.</p>
<p>It was not long before the big vessel was near
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
enough for the sailors to distinguish that there
were only two little girls on board the drifting
sloop, and a man was ready with a stout boat-hook,
which he grappled about the &#8220;Peggy&#8217;s&#8221;
mast, and a big man with reddish hair and blue
eyes slid down a rope and swung himself on
board the sloop.</p>
<p>&#8220;Zounds!&#8221; exclaimed the sailor, &#8220;if &#8217;Tis not
the little Province Town maid again! And
adrift like this. I&#8217;ll have to take you to England
and let Betsey and Harriet take care of
you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Before he had finished both Anne and Amanda
had begun to cry. They were sure now that
they should never see home again, and William
Trull had some trouble in convincing them that
he did not mean to take them to England.</p>
<p>But the captain had small patience with the
delay, and called out that &#8217;twas best to sink
the sloop rather than lose a fair wind out of
harbor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot be leaving two helpless maids
adrift,&#8221; William Trull called back. &#8220;They are
from the Province Town settlement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take them back to it, if you like, and find
your way across the Atlantic as best you may,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
retorted the English captain angrily. &#8220;We can&#8217;t
stand by for such folly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Poor William Trull looked at the little girls
in dismay. To be left stranded on American
territory was the last thing he desired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you tow our boat down to Province
Town?&#8221; pleaded Anne. &#8220;We won&#8217;t hurt you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha! ha!&#8221; laughed the captain, and even
William Trull joined in the laughter of the
crew, while Anne and Amanda wondered why
the sailors laughed. &#8220;Well,&#8221; and the captain&#8217;s
voice was more friendly as he leaned over his
ship&#8217;s railing and gazed down at the little girls,
&#8220;if you won&#8217;t run us down we&#8217;ll take you along
that far. You can stay on the sloop, Trull, till
we get near the tip of the cape. &#8217;Tis plain
American children are not easily frighted.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sloop was now taken in tow, and although
the little girls pleaded that a boat be
sent to find Amos, William Trull shook his
head.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;twill not do,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;to ask it of
the captain; and if the boy be a smart boy he&#8217;ll
make his way home, never fear.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was some comfort to Amanda to declare
that Amos was the smartest boy in the settlement;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
that he could make fire as Indians did,
and that he knew many ways of snaring birds
and fish.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never fear for a boy like that,&#8221; said the
sailor.</p>
<p>Anne was eager to ask him if he knew anything
of her father, and William Trull owned
that he did.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;twas your father who some way got word
to Newburyport and Portsmouth men to be
ready to fight,&#8221; he said. &#8220;&#8217;twas cleverly done,
they tell me, but no one has found out how.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Anne, &#8220;because I helped.&#8221;
Then remembering Captain Stoddard&#8217;s caution,
she put her hand over her mouth. &#8220;I must
not tell,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The sailor looked at her in astonishment.
&#8220;Even the children are &#8216;rebels,&#8217;&#8221; he declared,
&#8220;and helping when chance comes. &#8217;Tis a great
country. I&#8217;ll not question you, child, but I&#8217;ll
tell my little girls about you, and that you
helped to send the English home. Your own
father will soon be telling you how the Americans
drove the English; but you must keep a
kind thought for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I do wish you would stay and be an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
American, Mr. William Trull, and bring your
little girls to live in Province Town,&#8221; said
Anne.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who knows?&#8221; said the sailor. &#8220;It may be
I&#8217;ll be coming back with my family. I like
this country well. Your father will be coming
to Province Town soon, never fear,&#8221; he added,
&#8220;for now Boston port is open to all, and the
fishermen are going in and out as they please.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amanda had not been much interested in
what the sailor had to say. She was thinking
that Amos must be very hungry; and when
William Trull climbed aboard the big vessel
and the sloop dropped behind near the Province
Town shore, she was greatly rejoiced.</p>
<p>It was not long that the &#8220;Peggy&#8221; was alone.
Men on shore had been watching and were quick
to recognize the sloop, and a boat was sent out.
Amanda recognized that her father was in it, as
well as Captain Enos and Jimmie Starkweather,
and called out in delight. There was an anxious
crowd on the beach, and Mrs. Stoddard and
Amanda&#8217;s mother ran eagerly forward to greet
the little girls, and to ask what had become of
Amos.</p>
<p>It was soon evident that Jimmie Starkweather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
and the other boys were inclined to be envious
of Amos&#8217;s good fortune; and when Mr. Cary
made his own boat ready to sail for Barnstable
to bring Amos home Jimmie was very proud to
be selected to accompany him.</p>
<p>&#8220;How shall we ever feel safe about thee,
child?&#8221; said Mrs. Stoddard, as she and Anne
walked toward home. &#8220;Are you always to be
seeking your father without telling us? If you
had but waited you would have saved us all
this worry, and Amos would now be safe at
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I have news, Aunt Martha,&#8221; pleaded
Anne. &#8220;Mr. William Trull told me my father
might soon be with us. I will not leave you
again, unless, indeed, you no longer want me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course we want you, Anne. But I have
better news than the English sailor gave you.
Look! Here comes some one whom you will
be glad to see,&#8221; but before she had finished
speaking Anne had sprung forward with an exclamation
of delight, for her father was coming
down the path to the shore.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came down in one of Mr. Freeman&#8217;s fishing-boats,&#8221;
he explained, as, hand in hand, he
and Anne walked back to join Mrs. Stoddard.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
Anne danced along happily, and Mrs. Stoddard
smiled as she looked at the little girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now I hope for peace,&#8221; declared the
good woman. &#8220;Anne will not let you go again,
John Nelson. You will have to be content to
stay in Province Town.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next day Elder Haven came to see John
Nelson to hear more about the great triumphs
of the Americans; and when Anne&#8217;s father told
him of Captain Stoddard&#8217;s trip to Newburyport,
with Anne carrying the important message for
the Newburyport patriots, the good clergyman
held up his hands in wonder. &#8220;She is a brave
little maid,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It should be put on
record that a maid of Province Town helped the
Americans to win their just cause against King
George. Indeed it should.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is a brave child,&#8221; agreed Captain Enos.
&#8220;I was sure of it when I heard her defend her
father at the spring,&#8221; and the good captain
chuckled at the remembrance of Anne&#8217;s battle
with the Cary children, who were now her
staunchest friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amos is safe home, and proud enough; he
is lording it well over his mates,&#8221; said Elder
Haven. &#8220;You must not run away again,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
Anne,&#8221; he added more gravely, resting a gentle
hand on the dark head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, oh, no!&#8221; replied Anne, &#8220;not unless
my father and Aunt Martha and Uncle Enos go
with me.&#8221;</p>
